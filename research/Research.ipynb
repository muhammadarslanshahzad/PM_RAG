The Code is divided into 50 titles which represent \\nbroad  areas  subject  to  Federal  regulation.  Each  title  is  divided  into  chapters \\nwhich usually bear the name of the issuing agency. Each chapter is further sub-\\ndivided into parts covering specific regulatory areas. \\n\\nEach volume of the Code is revised at least once each calendar year and issued \\n\\non a quarterly basis approximately as follows: \\n\\nTitle 1 through Title 16..............................................................as of January 1 \\nTitle 17 through Title 27 .................................................................as of April 1 \\nTitle 28 through Title 41 ..................................................................as of July 1 \\nTitle 42 through Title 50 .............................................................as of October 1 \\n\\nThe appropriate revision date is printed on the cover of each volume. \\n\\nLEGAL STATUS \\n\\nThe  contents  of  the  Federal  Register  are  required  to  be  judicially  noticed  (44 \\nU.S.C. 1507). The Code of Federal Regulations is prima facie evidence of the text \\nof the original documents (44 U.S.C. 1510). \\n\\nHOW TO USE THE CODE OF FEDERAL REGULATIONS \\n\\nThe  Code  of  Federal  Regulations  is  kept  up  to  date  by  the  individual  issues \\nof  the  Federal  Register.  These  two  publications  must  be  used  together  to  deter-\\nmine the latest version of any given rule. \\n\\nTo determine whether a Code volume has been amended since its revision date \\n(in this case, October 1, 2021), consult the ‘‘List of CFR Sections Affected (LSA),’’ \\nwhich  is  issued  monthly,  and  the  ‘‘Cumulative  List  of  Parts  Affected,’’  which \\nappears in the Reader Aids section of the daily Federal Register. These two lists \\nwill  identify  the  Federal  Register  page  number  of  the  latest  amendment  of  any \\ngiven rule. \\n\\nEFFECTIVE AND EXPIRATION DATES \\n\\nEach  volume  of  the  Code  contains  amendments  published  in  the  Federal  Reg-\\nister  since  the  last  revision  of  that  volume  of  the  Code.  Source  citations  for \\nthe regulations are referred to by volume number and page number of the Federal \\nRegister  and  date  of  publication.  Publication  dates  and  effective  dates  are  usu-\\nally  not  the  same  and  care  must  be  exercised  by  the  user  in  determining  the \\nactual  effective  date.  In  instances  where  the  effective  date  is  beyond  the  cut- \\noff  date  for  the  Code  a  note  has  been  inserted  to  reflect  the  future  effective \\ndate.  In  those  instances  where  a  regulation  published  in  the  Federal  Register \\nstates a date certain for expiration, an appropriate note will be inserted following \\nthe text. \\n\\nOMB CONTROL NUMBERS \\n\\nThe Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980 (Pub. L. 96–511) requires Federal agencies \\nto  display  an  OMB  control  number  with  their  information  collection  request. \\n\\nv \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00005 Fmt 8008 Sfmt 8092 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cMany agencies have begun publishing numerous OMB control numbers as amend-\\nments  to  existing  regulations  in  the  CFR.  These  OMB  numbers  are  placed  as \\nclose as possible to the applicable recordkeeping or reporting requirements. \\n\\nPAST PROVISIONS OF THE CODE \\n\\nProvisions of the Code that are no longer in force and effect as of the revision \\ndate  stated  on  the  cover  of  each  volume  are  not  carried.  Code  users  may  find \\nthe text of provisions in effect on any given date in the past by using the appro-\\npriate  List  of  CFR  Sections  Affected  (LSA).  For  the  convenience  of  the  reader, \\na  ‘‘List  of  CFR  Sections  Affected’’  is  published  at  the  end  of  each  CFR  volume. \\nFor  changes  to  the  Code  prior  to  the  LSA  listings  at  the  end  of  the  volume, \\nconsult  previous  annual  editions  of  the  LSA.  For  changes  to  the  Code  prior  to \\n2001,  consult  the  List  of  CFR  Sections  Affected  compilations,  published  for  1949- \\n1963, 1964-1972, 1973-1985, and 1986-2000. \\n\\n‘‘[RESERVED]’’ TERMINOLOGY \\n\\nThe  term  ‘‘[Reserved]’’  is  used  as  a  place  holder  within  the  Code  of  Federal \\nRegulations. An agency may add regulatory information at a ‘‘[Reserved]’’ loca-\\ntion  at  any  time.  Occasionally  ‘‘[Reserved]’’  is  used  editorially  to  indicate  that \\na portion of the CFR was left vacant and not dropped in error. \\n\\nINCORPORATION BY REFERENCE \\n\\nWhat  is  incorporation  by  reference?  Incorporation  by  reference  was  established \\nby statute and allows Federal agencies to meet the requirement to publish regu-\\nlations  in  the  Federal  Register  by  referring  to  materials  already  published  else-\\nwhere.  For  an  incorporation  to  be  valid,  the  Director  of  the  Federal  Register \\nmust approve it. The legal effect of incorporation by reference is that the mate-\\nrial  is  treated  as  if  it  were  published  in  full  in  the  Federal  Register  (5  U.S.C. \\n552(a)).  This  material,  like  any  other  properly  issued  regulation,  has  the  force \\nof law. \\n\\nWhat is a proper incorporation by reference? The Director of the Federal Register \\nwill approve an incorporation by reference only when the requirements of 1 CFR \\npart 51 are met. Some of the elements on which approval is based are: \\n\\n(a)  The  incorporation  will  substantially  reduce  the  volume  of  material  pub-\\n\\nlished in the Federal Register. \\n\\n(b)  The  matter  incorporated  is  in  fact  available  to  the  extent  necessary  to \\n\\nafford fairness and uniformity in the administrative process. \\n\\n(c)  The  incorporating  document  is  drafted  and  submitted  for  publication  in \\n\\naccordance with 1 CFR part 51. \\n\\nWhat  if  the  material  incorporated  by  reference  cannot  be  found?  If  you  have  any \\nproblem locating or obtaining a copy of material listed as an approved incorpora-\\ntion by reference, please contact the agency that issued the regulation containing \\nthat  incorporation.  If,  after  contacting  the  agency,  you  find  the  material  is  not \\navailable,  please  notify  the  Director  of  the  Federal  Register,  National  Archives \\nand  Records  Administration,  8601  Adelphi  Road,  College  Park,  MD  20740-6001,  or \\ncall 202-741-6010. \\n\\nCFR INDEXES AND TABULAR GUIDES \\n\\nA  subject  index  to  the  Code  of  Federal  Regulations  is  contained  in  a  separate \\nvolume, revised annually as of January 1, entitled CFR INDEX AND FINDING AIDS. \\nThis volume contains the Parallel Table of Authorities and Rules. A list of CFR \\ntitles,  chapters,  subchapters,  and  parts  and  an  alphabetical  list  of  agencies  pub-\\nlishing in the CFR are also included in this volume. \\n\\nAn index to the text of ‘‘Title 3—The President’’ is carried within that volume. \\n\\nvi \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00006 Fmt 8008 Sfmt 8092 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cThe  Federal  Register  Index  is  issued  monthly  in  cumulative  form.

The burden of proof that an award \\nshould not be made to an eligible appli-\\ncant is on the Department where it has \\ninitiated  the  proceeding.  No  presump-\\ntion arises that the Department’s posi-\\ntion  was  not  substantially  justified \\nsimply because the Department did not \\nprevail.

The request should— \\n\\n(1)  Indicate  that  it  is  being  made \\n\\nunder FOIA; \\n\\n(2)  Display  the  word  ‘‘FOIA’’  promi-\\nnently  on  the  envelope  or  on  the  sub-\\nject line of the email or facsimile; \\n\\n(3)  Be  addressed  to  the  appropriate \\nFOIA  Requester  Service  Center  as  set \\nforth in § 7.27; \\n\\n(4) State the format (e.g., paper, com-\\npact  disc)  in  which  the  information  is \\nsought,  if  the  requester  has  a  pref-\\nerence (see § 7.26(c)); and \\n\\n(5)  Describe  the  record  or  records \\nsought to the fullest extent possible. In \\nthis regard, the request should describe \\nthe subject matter of the record and, if \\nknown,  indicate  the  date  when  it  was \\nmade, the place where it was made, and \\nthe individual or office that made it. If \\nthe  description  does  not  enable  the  of-\\nfice handling the request to identify or \\nlocate  the  record  sought,  that  office \\nwill  contact  the  requester  for  addi-\\ntional  information.  So  that  the  office \\nmay  contact  the  requester  for  addi-\\ntional  information,  the  request  should \\nprovide  the  requester’s  complete  con-\\ntact  information,  including  name,  ad-\\ndress, telephone number, and email ad-\\ndress, if any. \\n\\n(b)  With  respect  to  fees,  the  request \\n\\nmust— \\n\\n(1) Specify the fee category (commer-\\ncial use, news media, educational insti-\\ntution,  noncommercial  scientific  insti-\\ntution,  or  other;  see  § 7.42(g))  in  which \\nthe  requester  claims  the  request  falls \\nand the basis of this claim (see subpart \\nE  of  this  Part  for  fees  and  fee  waiver \\nrequirements); \\n\\n(2) Support any request for fee waiver \\nby addressing, to the fullest extent pos-\\nsible,  how  the  criteria  set  out  in \\n§ 7.43(c)  for  establishing  that  the  re-\\nquest  is  in  the  public  interest  have \\nbeen met, if relevant; \\n\\n(3)  State  the  maximum  amount  of \\nfees that the requester is willing to pay \\nand/or include a request for a fee waiv-\\ner or reduction (if a maximum amount \\nis  not  stated  by  the  requester,  DOT \\nwill  assume  the  requester  is  willing  to \\npay up to US $25); \\n\\n(c)  If  the  requester  seeks  expedited \\nprocessing at the time of the initial re-\\nquest,  the  request  must  include  a \\nstatement  supporting  expedited  proc-\\nessing, as set forth in § 7.31(c); \\n\\n65 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00075 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0c§ 7.25 \\n\\n49 CFR Subtitle A (10–1–21 Edition) \\n\\n(d)  A  request  is  not  considered  to  be \\na FOIA request if the record or records \\nsought  are \\ninsufficiently  described \\nsuch  that  DOT  is  unable  to  respond  as \\nrequired  by  FOIA.  The  twenty  Federal \\nworking day limit for responding to re-\\nquests, described in § 7.31(a)(2), will not \\nstart  to  run  until  the  request  is  deter-\\nmined by DOT to be sufficiently under-\\nstood to enable DOT to respond as con-\\ntemplated  under  FOIA  (or  would  have \\nbeen so determined with the exercise of \\ndue  diligence  by  an  employee  of  DOT) \\nand  is  considered  received  (see  para-\\ngraph (e)); and \\n\\n(e) Provided the request is considered \\nto  be  a  FOIA  request  (see  paragraph \\n(d)),  the  request  is  considered  received \\nwhen  it  is  first  received  by  the  FOIA \\noffice  to  which  it  should  have  been \\noriginally  sent,  as  shown  in  § 7.27,  but \\nin any event not later than ten Federal \\nworking  days  after  it  is  first  received \\nby  any  DOT  FOIA  Requester  Service \\nCenter identified in § 7.27. \\n\\n(f)  As  provided  in  § 7.35,  DOT’s  time \\nlimit for responding to a FOIA request \\nas set forth in subpart D may be tolled \\none  time  to  seek  additional  informa-\\ntion  needed  to  clarify  the  request  and \\nas  often  as  necessary  to  clarify  fee \\nissues with the requester. \\n\\n§ 7.25 How  does  DOT  handle  first- \\n\\nparty requests? \\n\\n(a)  DOT  processes  FOIA  requests \\nfrom  first-party  requesters  in  accord-\\nance  with  this  regulation.  DOT  also \\nprocesses  such  requests  in  accordance \\nwith  the  Privacy  Act  (5  U.S.C.  552a)  if \\nthe records reside in a Privacy Act sys-\\ntem  of  records  (defined  in  5  U.S.C. \\n552a(a)(5) as a system from which infor-\\nmation  is  retrieved  by  the  individual’s \\nname  or  some  other  personal  identi-\\nfier). Whichever statute provides great-\\ner access is controlling. \\n\\n(b) First party requesters must estab-\\nlish  their  identity  to  DOT’s  satisfac-\\ntion  before  DOT  will  process  the  re-\\nquest under the Privacy Act. DOT may \\nrequest  that  first  party  requesters  au-\\nthenticate their identity to assist with \\nour  evaluation  of  the  application  of \\nFOIA  exemptions,  such  as  FOIA  Ex-\\nemption  6,  5  U.S.C.  552(b)(6),  to  the  re-\\nquested records. Acceptable methods of \\nauthenticating the requester’s identity \\n\\ninclude  those  outlined  in  DOT’s  Pri-\\nvacy Act regulations at 49 CFR 10.37. \\n\\n§ 7.26 To  what  extent  and  in  what  for-\\nmat are records searched and made \\navailable? \\n\\n(a)  Existing  records.  A  request  may \\nseek only records that are in existence \\nat  the  time  of  the  request.  In  deter-\\nmining which records are responsive to \\na  request,  DOT  ordinarily  will  include \\nonly records in its possession as of the \\ndate  it  begins  its  search  for  them.  If \\nany other date is used, DOT will inform \\nthe  requester  of  that  date.  DOT  con-\\nsiders  records  created  after  the  begin-\\nning of the search to be non-responsive \\nto a request. A request made under this \\nsubpart  may  not  require  that  new \\nrecords  be  created  in  response  to  the \\nrequest  by,  for  example,  combining  or \\ncompiling  selected  items  from  manual \\nfiles,  preparing  a  new  computer  pro-\\ngram,  or  calculating  proportions,  per-\\ncentages, \\ndistributions, \\ntrends,  or  comparisons.  DOT  may,  in \\nits  discretion,  create  a  new  record  as \\nan  alternative  to  disclosing  existing \\nrecords,  if  DOT  determines  that  cre-\\nating a new record will be less burden-\\nsome  than  disclosing  large  volumes  of \\nunassembled  material  and  if  the  re-\\nquester  consents  to  accept  the  newly- \\ncreated  record  in  lieu  of  the  existing \\nrecords. \\n\\nfrequency \\n\\n(b)  Electronic  records.  DOT  makes  a \\nreasonable  effort  to  search  electronic \\nrecords  without  significantly  inter-\\nfering  with  the  operation  of  the  af-\\nfected information system. \\n\\n(c)  Format  of  production.  DOT  pro-\\nvides  records  in  the  form  or  format \\nsought  by  the  requester,  if  the  records \\nare readily reproducible in that form or \\nformat. \\n\\n(d)  Photocopying  of  records.  Original \\nrecords  ordinarily  are  copied  except \\nwhere,  in  DOT’s  judgment,  copying \\nwould  endanger  the  quality  of  the \\noriginal  or  raise  the  reasonable  possi-\\nbility  of  irreparable  harm  to  the \\nrecord.  Original  records  are  not  re-\\nleased  from  DOT  custody.

At the same time, DOT notifies \\nthe requester that notice and an oppor-\\ntunity  to  comment  are  being  provided \\nto  the  submitter.  To  the  extent  per-\\nmitted  by  law,  DOT  affords  the  sub-\\nmitter  a  reasonable  period  of  time  to \\nprovide  a  detailed  statement  of  any \\nsuch objections. The submitter’s state-\\nment must specify all grounds for with-\\nholding  any  of  the  information.  The \\nburden  is  on  the  submitter  to  identify \\nwith  specificity  all  information  for \\nwhich  exempt  treatment  is  sought  and \\nto  persuade  the  agency  that  the  infor-\\nmation should not be disclosed. \\n\\n(b)  The  responsible  DOT  component, \\nto  the  extent  permitted  by  law,  con-\\nsiders  carefully  a  submitter’s  objec-\\ntions  and  specific  grounds  for  non-\\ndisclosure  prior  to  determining  wheth-\\ner to disclose commercial information. \\nWhenever DOT decides to disclose such \\ninformation  over  the  objection  of  a \\nsubmitter,  the  office  responsible  for \\nthe  decision  provides  the  submitter \\nwith  a  written  notice  of  intent  to  dis-\\nclose,  which  is  sent  to  the  submitter  a \\n\\nreasonable number of days prior to the \\nspecified  date  upon  which  disclosure  is \\nintended.

If DOT de-\\ncides  to  grant  the  request  in  full  or  in \\npart,  DOT  makes  the  record  (or  the \\ngranted  part)  available  as  promptly  as \\npossible  and  provides  the  requester \\nwith  written  notification  of  DOT’s  de-\\ntermination, the reasons for the  deter-\\nmination,  and  the  right  of  the  re-\\nquester  to  seek  assistance  from  the \\nFOIA Public Liaison. If DOT denies the \\nrequest  in  full  or  in  part,  because  the \\nrecord (or the denied part) is subject to \\nan exemption, is not within DOT’s cus-\\ntody  and  control,  or  was  not  located \\nfollowing a reasonable search, DOT no-\\ntifies  the  requester  of  the  denial  in \\nwriting  and  includes  in  the  notice  the \\nreason for the determination, the right \\nof  the  requester  to  appeal  the  deter-\\nmination,  the  name  and  title  of  each \\nindividual  responsible  for  the  initial \\ndetermination to deny the request, and \\nthe  requester’s  right  to  seek  dispute \\nresolution services from the FOIA Pub-\\nlic Liaison or the Office of Government \\nInformation Services.

It  is  not  always \\nfeasible to rely upon the subject of an inves-\\ntigation  as  a  source  for  information  that \\nmay  implicate  him/her  in  illegal  activities. \\nIn  addition,  collecting  information  directly \\nfrom the subject could seriously compromise \\nan  investigation  by  prematurely  revealing \\nits  nature  and  scope,  or  could  provide  the \\nsubject  with  an  opportunity  to  conceal \\ncriminal  activities,  or  intimidate  potential \\nsources, in order to avoid apprehension. \\n\\n5.

In  evaluating  risks \\nand  benefits,  the  IRB  should  consider \\nonly those risks and benefits that may \\nresult  from  the  research  (as  distin-\\nguished  from  risks  and  benefits  of \\ntherapies subjects would receive even if \\nnot  participating  in  the  research).  The \\nIRB  should  not  consider  possible  long- \\nrange  effects  of  applying  knowledge \\ngained  in  the  research  (e.g.,  the  pos-\\nsible  effects  of  the  research  on  public \\npolicy)  as  among  those  research  risks \\nthat  fall  within  the  purview  of  its  re-\\nsponsibility. \\n\\n(3)  Selection  of  subjects  is  equitable. \\nIn  making  this  assessment  the  IRB \\nshould  take  into  account  the  purposes \\nof  the  research  and  the  setting  in \\nwhich  the  research  will  be  conducted. \\nThe  IRB  should  be  particularly  cog-\\nnizant  of  the  special  problems  of  re-\\nsearch that involves a category of sub-\\njects who are vulnerable to coercion or \\nundue influence, such as children, pris-\\noners,  individuals  with  impaired  deci-\\nsion-making  capacity,  or  economically \\nor  educationally  disadvantaged  per-\\nsons. \\n\\n(4)  Informed  consent  will  be  sought \\nfrom  each  prospective  subject  or  the \\nsubject’s legally authorized representa-\\ntive, in accordance with, and to the ex-\\ntent required by, § 11.116. \\n\\n(5)  Informed  consent  will  be  appro-\\npriately  documented  or  appropriately \\nwaived in accordance with § 11.117. \\n\\n(6)  When  appropriate,  the  research \\nplan  makes  adequate  provision  for \\nmonitoring  the  data  collected  to  en-\\nsure the safety of subjects. \\n\\n110 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00120 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cOffice of the Secretary of Transportation \\n\\n§ 11.114 \\n\\n(7)  When  appropriate,  there  are  ade-\\nquate provisions to protect the privacy \\nof  subjects  and  to  maintain  the  con-\\nfidentiality of data. \\n\\n(i)  The  Secretary  of  HHS  will,  after \\nconsultation  with  the  Office  of  Man-\\nagement  and  Budget’s  privacy  office \\nand  other  Federal  departments  and \\nagencies that have adopted this policy, \\nissue guidance to assist IRBs in assess-\\ning  what  provisions  are  adequate  to \\nprotect  the  privacy  of  subjects  and  to \\nmaintain the confidentiality of data. \\n\\nIRB \\n\\n(ii) [Reserved] \\n(8)  For  purposes  of  conducting  the \\nlimited \\nrequired  by \\nreview \\n§ 11.104(d)(7)),  the  IRB  need  not  make \\nthe determinations at paragraphs (a)(1) \\nthrough  (7)  of  this  section,  and  shall \\nmake the following determinations: \\n\\n(i) Broad consent for storage, mainte-\\nnance,  and  secondary  research  use  of \\nidentifiable  private \\ninformation  or \\nidentifiable biospecimens is obtained in \\naccordance  with  the  requirements  of \\n§ 11.116(a)(1)–(4), (a)(6), and (d); \\n\\n(ii)  Broad  consent  is  appropriately \\ndocumented  or  waiver  of  documenta-\\ntion is appropriate, in accordance with \\n§ 11.117; and \\n\\n(iii) If there is a change made for re-\\nsearch purposes in the way the identifi-\\nable private information or identifiable \\nbiospecimens are stored or maintained, \\nthere  are  adequate  provisions  to  pro-\\ntect  the  privacy  of  subjects  and  to \\nmaintain the confidentiality of data. \\n\\n(b)  When  some  or  all  of  the  subjects \\nare  likely  to  be  vulnerable  to  coercion \\nor  undue  influence,  such  as  children, \\nprisoners,  individuals  with  impaired \\ndecision-making  capacity,  or  economi-\\ncally  or  educationally  disadvantaged \\npersons,  additional  safeguards  have \\nbeen  included  in  the  study  to  protect \\nthe  rights  and  welfare  of  these  sub-\\njects. \\n\\n§ 11.112 Review by Institution \\n\\nResearch  covered  by  this  policy  that \\nhas  been  approved  by  an  IRB  may  be \\nsubject  to  further  appropriate  review \\nand approval or disapproval by officials \\nof  the  institution.

Prior to \\nproviding  SSI  to  a  person  under  para-\\ngraph  (d)(1)  of  this  section,  the  Sec-\\nretary  of  DOT  may  require  the  indi-\\nvidual  or,  in  the  case  of  an  entity,  the \\nindividuals  representing  the  entity, \\nand  their  counsel,  to  undergo  and  sat-\\nisfy,  in  the  judgment  of  the  Secretary \\nof DOT, a security background check. \\n\\n(e)  Other  conditional  disclosure.  The \\nSecretary of DOT may authorize a con-\\nditional  disclosure  of  specific  records \\nor  information  that  constitute  SSI \\nupon the written determination by the \\nSecretary  that  disclosure  of  such \\nrecords or information, subject to such \\n\\nlimitations and restrictions as the Sec-\\nretary may prescribe, would not be det-\\nrimental to transportation safety. \\n\\n(f)  Obligation  to  protect  information. \\nWhen an individual receives SSI pursu-\\nant  to  paragraph  (d)  or  (e)  of  this  sec-\\ntion that individual becomes a covered \\nperson under § 15.7 and is subject to the \\nobligations  of  a  covered  person  under \\nthis part. \\n\\n(g) No release under FOIA. When DOT \\ndiscloses  SSI  pursuant  to  paragraphs \\n(b)  through  (e)  of  this  section,  DOT \\nmakes  the  disclosure  for  the  sole  pur-\\npose described in that paragraph. Such \\ndisclosure is not a public release of in-\\nformation  under  the  Freedom  of  Infor-\\nmation Act. \\n\\n(h)  Disclosure  of  Critical  Infrastructure \\nInformation.  Disclosure  of  information \\nthat  is  both  SSI  and  has  been  des-\\nignated as critical infrastructure infor-\\nmation  under  section  214  of  the  Home-\\nland Security Act is governed solely by \\nthe requirements of section 214 and any \\nimplementing regulations. \\n\\n§ 15.17 Consequences  of  unauthorized \\n\\ndisclosure of SSI. \\n\\nViolation of this part is grounds for a \\ncivil penalty and other enforcement or \\ncorrective  action  by  DOT,  and  appro-\\npriate  personnel  actions  for  Federal \\nemployees.  Corrective  action  may  in-\\nclude issuance of an order requiring re-\\ntrieval  of  SSI  to  remedy  unauthorized \\ndisclosure  or  an  order  to  cease  future \\nunauthorized disclosure. \\n\\n§ 15.19 Destruction of SSI. \\n\\n(a) DOT. Subject to the requirements \\nof  the  Federal  Records  Act  (5  U.S.C. \\n105),  including  the  duty  to  preserve \\nrecords  containing  documentation  of  a \\nFederal  agency’s  policies,  decisions, \\nand  essential  transactions,  DOT  de-\\nstroys  SSI  when  no  longer  needed  to \\ncarry out the agency’s function. \\n\\n(b)  Other  covered  persons—(1)  In  gen-\\neral.  A  covered  person  must  destroy \\nSSI completely to preclude recognition \\nor  reconstruction  of  the  information \\nwhen  the  covered  person  no  longer \\nneeds  the  SSI  to  carry  out  transpor-\\ntation security measures. \\n\\n(2)  Exception.

Subsequent  interest \\nrate  changes  may  occur  no  more  than \\nmonthly. \\n\\n(c)  Loan  Structure  and  Term.  A  STLP \\nloan shall be set up as a revolving line \\nof  credit.  The  line  permits  the  bor-\\nrower  to  request  principal  advances, \\npay  them  back,  and  then  re-borrow, \\nnot to exceed the face value of the line \\nof credit. Participating Lenders are re-\\nquired  to  provide  DOT  OSDBU  written \\nnotification  of  the  activation  date  of \\neach  line  of  credit  under  the  STLP. \\nThe  term  of  the  Federal  guarantee  of \\nthe line of credit commences on the ac-\\ntivation date. \\n\\n(d)  Repayment.

The Participating Lender \\nmust verify the accuracy of the invoice \\nwith the paying transportation govern-\\nment agency, if the borrower is a prime \\ncontractor,  and/or  with  the  prime  con-\\ntractor,  if  the  borrower  is  a  subcon-\\ntractor.  This  verification  must  be  ob-\\ntained  by  the  Participating  Lender \\nprior to advancing funds.

If  the \\ndisbursement  of  STLP  funds  is  being \\nsent  to  the  borrower  through  a  local \\nParticipating Lender, the disbursement \\nshould  be  made  by  electronic  funds \\ntransfer  with  the  preferred  method  of \\npayment being the Automated Clearing \\nHouse (ACH) system. \\n\\n(3) Wire transfers. Wire transfers can \\nbe used if the ACH system is not avail-\\nable  or  if  a  same  day  disbursement  is \\nrequired. \\n\\n(4) Joint payee check system. A two- \\nparty  payee  check  system  is  required \\nin  which  the  Participating  Lender  and \\nthe  borrower  will  be  the  co-payees  of \\nany  checks  paid  to  the  borrower  for \\nperformance  under  the  assigned  con-\\ntract.

However  the  supplier  pro-\\nvides  goods  to  a  retail  establishment  in  the \\nairport; or the management contractor oper-\\nates  the  parking  facility  on  the  airport. \\nThese  businesses  are  considered  concessions \\nfor purposes of this part. \\n\\n(3)  For  purposes  of  this  subpart,  a \\n\\nbusiness  is  not  considered  to  be  ‘‘lo-\\ncated  on  the  airport’’  solely  because  it \\npicks  up  and/or  delivers  customers \\nunder a permit, license, or other agree-\\nment.  For  example,  providers  of  taxi, \\nlimousine, car rental, or hotel services \\nare not considered to be located on the \\nairport just because they send shuttles \\nonto  airport  grounds  to  pick  up  pas-\\nsengers or drop them off.

The \\nfollowing  are  examples  of  race-con-\\nscious measures you can implement: \\n\\n(1)  Establishing  concession-specific \\ngoals  for  particular  concession  oppor-\\ntunities. \\n\\n(i)  If  the  objective  of  the  concession- \\nspecific  goal  is  to  obtain  ACDBE  par-\\nticipation  through  a  direct  ownership \\narrangement  with  a  ACDBE,  calculate \\nthe goal as a percentage of the total es-\\ntimated annual gross receipts from the \\nconcession. \\n\\n(ii)  If  the  goal  applies  to  purchases \\nand/or leases of goods and services, cal-\\nculate  the  goal  by  dividing  the  esti-\\nmated  dollar  value  of  such  purchases \\nand/or  leases  from  ACDBEs  by  the \\ntotal estimated dollar value of all pur-\\nchases  to  be  made  by  the  conces-\\nsionaire. \\n\\n(iii)  To  be  eligible  to  be  awarded  the \\nconcession,  competitors  must  make \\ngood  faith  efforts  to  meet  this  goal.  A \\ncompetitor may do so either by obtain-\\ning  enough  ACDBE  participation  to \\nmeet  the  goal  or  by  documenting  that \\nit  made  sufficient  good  faith  efforts  to \\ndo so. \\n\\n(iv)  The  administrative  procedures \\napplicable  to  contract  goals  in  part  26, \\n§ 26.51–53, apply with respect to conces-\\nsion-specific goals. \\n\\n(2)  Negotiation  with  a  potential  con-\\ncessionaire  to  include  ACDBE  partici-\\npation,  through  direct  ownership  ar-\\nrangements  or  measures,  in  the  oper-\\nation of the concession. \\n\\n(3)  With  the  prior  approval  of  FAA, \\nother methods that take a competitor’s \\nability to provide ACDBE participation \\ninto account in awarding a concession. \\n(f)  Your  ACDBE  program  must  re-\\nquire  businesses  subject  to  ACDBE \\ngoals  at  the  airport  (except  car  rental \\ncompanies)  to  make  good  faith  efforts \\nto explore all available options to meet \\ngoals,  to  the  maximum  extent  prac-\\nticable,  through  direct  ownership  ar-\\nrangements with DBEs. \\n\\n167 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00177 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0c§ 23.27 \\n\\n49 CFR Subtitle A (10–1–21 Edition) \\n\\n(g)  As  provided  in  § 23.61  of  this  part, \\nyou must not use set-asides and quotas \\nas  means  of  obtaining  ACDBE  partici-\\npation. \\n\\n§ 23.27 What information does a recipi-\\nent  have  to  retain  and  report  about \\nimplementation  of  its  ACDBE  pro-\\ngram? \\n\\n(a)  As  a  recipient,  you  must  retain \\nsufficient basic information about your \\nprogram  implementation,  your  certifi-\\ncation  of  ACDBEs,  and  the  award  and \\nperformance  of  agreements  and  con-\\ntracts  to  enable  the  FAA  to  determine \\nyour  compliance  with  this  part.

You  do  not \\ninclude  gross  receipts  of  other  conces-\\nsions in this base. \\n\\n§ 23.51 How  are  a  recipient’s  overall \\ngoals expressed and calculated? \\n\\n(a) Your objective in setting a goal is \\nto  estimate  the  percentage  of  the  base \\ncalculated  under \\n§§ 23.47–23.49  that \\nwould  be  performed  by  ACDBEs  in  the \\nabsence  of  discrimination  and  its  ef-\\nfects. \\n\\n(1)  This  percentage  is  the  estimated \\nACDBE  participation  that  would  occur \\nif there were a ‘‘level playing field’’ for \\nfirms  to  work  as  concessionaires  for \\nyour airport. \\n\\n(2)  In  conducting  this  goal  setting \\nprocess,  you  are  determining  the  ex-\\ntent, if any, to which the firms in your \\nmarket  area  have  suffered  discrimina-\\ntion  or  its  effects  in  connection  with \\nconcession  opportunities  or  related \\nbusiness opportunities. \\n\\n(3)  You  must  complete  the  goal-set-\\nting  process  separately  for  each  of  the \\ntwo overall goals identified in § 23.41 of \\nthis part. \\n\\n(b)(1)  Each  overall  concessions  goal \\nmust  be  based  on  demonstrable  evi-\\ndence of the availability of ready, will-\\ning  and  able  ACDBEs  relative  to  all \\nbusinesses  ready,  willing  and  able  to \\nparticipate  in  your  ACDBE  program \\n(hereafter, the ‘‘relative availability of \\nACDBEs’’). \\n\\n(2)  You  cannot  simply  rely  on  the  10 \\npercent  national  aspirational  goal, \\nyour  previous  overall  goal,  or  past \\nACDBE participation rates in your pro-\\ngram  without  reference  to  the  relative \\navailability  of  ACDBEs  in  your  mar-\\nket. \\n\\n(3)  Your  market  area  is  defined  by \\nthe geographical area in which the sub-\\nstantial  majority  of  firms  which  seek \\nto do concessions business with the air-\\nport  are  located  and  the  geographical \\narea  in  which  the  firms  which  receive \\nthe  substantial  majority  of  conces-\\nlocated. \\nsions-related  revenues  are \\nYour market area may be different  for \\ndifferent types of concessions. \\n\\n(c)  Step  1.  You  must  begin  your  goal \\nsetting  process  by  determining  a  base \\nfigure  for  the  relative  availability  of \\nACDBEs. The following are examples of \\napproaches  that  you  may  take  toward \\ndetermining a base figure. These exam-\\nples are provided as a starting point for \\nyour goal setting process. Any percent-\\nage figure derived from one of these ex-\\namples  should  be  considered  a  basis \\nfrom  which  you  begin  when  examining \\nthe  evidence  available  to  you.  These \\nexamples  are  not  intended  as  an  ex-\\nhaustive  list.  Other  methods  or  com-\\nbinations  of  methods  to  determine  a \\nbase figure may be used, subject to ap-\\nproval by the FAA. \\n\\n(1) Use DBE Directories and Census Bu-\\nreau  Data.  Determine  the  number  of \\nready,  willing  and  able  ACDBEs  in \\nyour market area from your ACDBE di-\\nrectory.  Using  the  Census  Bureau’s \\nCounty  Business  Pattern  (CBP)  data \\nbase,  determine  the  number  of  all \\nready,  willing  and  able  businesses \\navailable in your market area that per-\\nform  work  in  the  same  NAICS  codes. \\n(Information  about  the  CBP  data  base \\nmay  be  obtained  from  the  Census  Bu-\\nreau  at \\nsite,  http:// \\nwww.census.gov/epcd/cbp/view/ \\ncbpview.html.)  Divide  the  number  of \\nACDBEs  by  the  number  of  all  busi-\\nnesses  to  derive  a  base  figure  for  the \\nrelative availability of ACDBEs in your \\nmarket area. \\n\\ntheir  Web \\n\\n(2) Use an Active Participants List. De-\\ntermine  the  number  of  ACDBEs  that \\nhave  participated  or  attempted  to  par-\\nticipate  in  your  airport  concessions \\nprogram  in  previous  years.  Determine \\nthe  number  of  all  businesses  that  have \\nparticipated  or  attempted  to  partici-\\npate  in  your  airport  concession  pro-\\ngram  in  previous  years.

(i)  You  may \\nuse other methods to determine a base \\nfigure for your overall goal. Any meth-\\nodology  you  choose  must  be  based  on \\ndemonstrable  evidence  of  local  market \\nconditions  and  be  designed  to  ulti-\\nmately attain a goal that is rationally \\nrelated  to  the  relative  availability  of \\nACDBEs in your market area. \\n\\n(ii)  In  the  case  of  a  car  rental  goal, \\nwhere it appears that all or most of the \\ngoal  is  likely  to  be  met  through  the \\npurchases  by  car  rental  companies  of \\nvehicles or other goods or services from \\nACDBEs, one permissible alternative is \\nto structure the goal entirely in terms \\nof  purchases  of  goods  and  services.  In \\nthis case, you would calculate your car \\nrental overall goal by dividing the esti-\\nmated  dollar  value  of  such  purchases \\nfrom  ACDBEs  by  the  total  estimated \\ndollar value of all purchases to be made \\nby car rental companies. \\n\\n(d) Step 2. Once you have calculated a \\nbase  figure,  you  must  examine  all  rel-\\nevant  evidence  reasonably  available  in \\nyour  jurisdiction  to  determine  what \\nadjustment,  if  any,  is  needed  to  the \\nbase  figure  in  order  to  arrive  at  your \\noverall goal. \\n\\n(1) There are many types of evidence \\nthat  must  be  considered  when  adjust-\\ning  the  base  figure.  These  include,  but \\nare not limited to: \\n\\n(i)  The  current  capacity  of  ACDBEs \\nto  perform  work  in  your  concessions \\nprogram, as measured by the volume of \\nwork  ACDBEs  have  performed  in  re-\\ncent years; and \\n\\n(ii)  Evidence  from  disparity  studies \\nconducted  anywhere  within  your  juris-\\ndiction,  to  the  extent  it  is  not  already \\naccounted for in your base figure. \\n\\n(2)  If  your  base  figure  is  the  goal  of \\nanother  recipient,  you  must  adjust  it \\nfor differences in your market area and \\nyour concessions program. \\n\\n(3)  If  available,  you  must  consider \\nevidence from related fields that affect \\nthe  opportunities  for  ACDBEs  to  form, \\ngrow  and  compete.  These  include,  but \\nare not limited to: \\n\\n(i)  Statistical  disparities  in  the  abil-\\nity  of  ACDBEs  to  get  the  financing, \\nbonding and insurance required to par-\\nticipate in your program; \\n\\n(ii)  Data  on  employment,  self-em-\\nployment,  education,  training  and \\nunion  apprenticeship  programs,  to  the \\nextent you can relate it to the opportu-\\nnities  for  ACDBEs  to  perform  in  your \\nprogram. \\n\\n(4) If you attempt to make an adjust-\\nment to your base figure to account for \\nthe continuing effects of past discrimi-\\nnation,  or  the  effects  of  an  ongoing \\nACDBE  program,  the  adjustment  must \\nbe based on demonstrable evidence that \\nis  logically  and  directly  related  to  the \\neffect  for  which  the  adjustment  is \\nsought. \\n\\n(5)  Among  the  information  you  sub-\\nmit with your overall goal (see 23.45(e)), \\nyou  must  include  description  of  the \\nmethodology  you  used  to  establish  the \\ngoal,  including  your  base  figure  and \\nthe  evidence  with  which  it  was  cal-\\nculated, as well as the adjustments you \\nmade  to  the  base  figure  and  the  evi-\\ndence  relied  on  for  the  adjustments. \\nYou  should  also  include  a  summary \\nlisting  of  the  relevant  available  evi-\\ndence  in  your  jurisdiction  and  an  ex-\\nplanation  of  how  you  used  that  evi-\\ndence  to  adjust  your  base  figure.  You \\nmust  also  include  your  projection  of \\nthe portions of the overall goal you ex-\\npect  to  meet  through  race-neutral  and \\nrace-conscious  measures,  respectively \\n(see §§ 26.51(c)). \\n\\n(e)  You  are  not  required  to  obtain \\nprior FAA concurrence with your over-\\nall  goal  (i.e.,  with  the  number  itself). \\nHowever,  if  the  FAA’s  review  suggests \\nthat  your  overall  goal  has  not  been \\ncorrectly  calculated,  or  that  your \\nmethod  for  calculating  goals  is  inad-\\nequate,  the  FAA  may,  after  consulting \\nwith  you,  adjust  your  overall  goal  or \\nrequire  that  you  do  so.  The  adjusted \\noverall goal is binding on you. \\n\\n(f) If you need additional time to col-\\nlect data or take other steps to develop \\nan  approach  to  setting  overall  goals, \\nyou  may  request  the  approval  of  the \\nFAA Administrator for an interim goal \\nand/or  goal-setting  mechanism.  Such  a \\nmechanism must: \\n\\n(1) Reflect the relative availability of \\nACDBEs  in  your  local  market  area  to \\nthe maximum extent feasible given the \\ndata available to you; and \\n\\n(2)  Avoid  imposing  undue  burdens  on \\n\\nnon-ACDBEs. \\n\\n173 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00183 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0c§ 23.53 \\n\\n49 CFR Subtitle A (10–1–21 Edition) \\n\\n§ 23.53 How  do  car  rental  companies \\ncount  ACDBE  participation  toward \\ntheir goals? \\n\\n(a)  As  a  car  rental  company,  you \\nmay,  in  meeting  the  goal  the  airport \\nhas  set  for  you,  include  purchases  or \\nleases of vehicles from any vendor that \\nis a certified ACDBE. \\n\\n(b)  As  a  car  rental  company,  if  you \\nchoose to meet the goal the airport has \\nset  for  you  by  including  purchases  or \\nleases of vehicles from an ACDBE ven-\\ndor,  you  must  also  submit  to  the  re-\\ncipient  documentation  of  the  good \\nfaith  efforts  you  have  made  to  obtain \\nACDBE \\nfrom  other \\nACDBE providers of goods and services. \\n(c)  While  this  part  does  not  require \\nyou  to  obtain  ACDBE  participation \\nthrough  direct  ownership  arrange-\\nments,  you  may  count  such  participa-\\ntion toward the goal the airport has set \\nfor you. \\n\\nparticipation \\n\\n(d)  The  following  special  rules  apply \\nto counting participation related to car \\nrental operations: \\n\\n(1)  Count  the  entire  amount  of  the \\ncost  charged  by  an  ACDBE  for  repair-\\ning vehicles, provided that it is reason-\\nable  and  not  excessive  as  compared \\nwith fees customarily allowed for simi-\\nlar services. \\n\\n(2)  Count  the  entire  amount  of  the \\nfee or commission charged by a ACDBE \\nto  manage  a  car  rental  concession \\nunder  an  agreement  with  the  conces-\\nsionaire toward ACDBE goals, provided \\nthat  it  is  reasonable  and  not  excessive \\nas  compared  with  fees  customarily  al-\\nlowed for similar services. \\n\\n(3) Do not count any portion  of a fee \\npaid by a manufacturer to a car dealer-\\nship  for  reimbursement  of  work  per-\\nformed  under  the  manufacturer’s  war-\\nranty. \\n\\n(e)  For  other  goods  and  services, \\ncount  participation  toward  ACDBE \\ngoals  as  provided  in  part  26,  § 26.55  and \\n§ 23.55  of  this  part.

A ‘‘subconcession’’ is a firm that has a \\nsublease  or  other  agreement  with  a  prime \\nconcessionaire,  rather  than  with  the  airport \\nitself, to operate a concession at the airport. \\nA  ‘‘management  contract’’  is  an  agreement \\nbetween  the  airport  and  a  firm  to  manage  a \\nportion  of  the  airport’s  facilities  or  oper-\\n\\nin \\n\\neach \\n\\nparticipation \\n\\nIn  Column  C,  enter  the  total  gross  reve-\\nnues \\ncategory \\n(ACDBEs) only.

The  term  func-\\ntionally  equivalent  means  that  it  per-\\nforms  the  same  function,  and  provides \\nthe  same  utility.  While  a  comparable \\nreplacement  dwelling  need  not  possess \\nevery \\nfeature  of  the  displacement \\ndwelling,  the  principal  features  must \\nbe  present.  Generally, \\nfunctional \\nequivalency  is  an  objective  standard, \\nreflecting  the  range  of  purposes  for \\nwhich  the  various  physical  features  of \\na  dwelling  may  be  used.  However,  in \\ndetermining  whether  a  replacement \\ndwelling  is  functionally  equivalent  to \\nthe  displacement  dwelling,  the  Agency \\nmay  consider  reasonable  trade-offs  for \\nspecific features when the replacement \\nunit is equal to or better than  the dis-\\nplacement  dwelling  (See  appendix  A, \\n§ 24.2(a)(6)); \\n\\n(iii)  Adequate  in  size  to  accommo-\\n\\ndate the occupants; \\n\\n(iv)  In  an  area  not  subject  to  unrea-\\nsonable  adverse  environmental  condi-\\ntions; \\n\\n(v)  In  a  location  generally  not  less \\ndesirable  than  the  location  of  the  dis-\\nplaced  person’s  dwelling  with  respect \\nto  public  utilities  and  commercial  and \\npublic  facilities,  and  reasonably  acces-\\nsible  to  the  person’s  place  of  employ-\\nment; \\n\\n(vi)  On  a  site  that  is  typical  in  size \\nfor  residential  development  with  nor-\\nmal  site  improvements,  including  cus-\\ntomary  landscaping.  The  site  need  not \\ninclude  special  improvements  such  as \\noutbuildings, \\nswimming  pools,  or \\ngreenhouses.

Such  rental  assistance \\nmust  be  paid  under  § 24.404,  Replace-\\nment housing of last resort. \\n\\n(ix)  For  a  person  receiving  govern-\\nment  housing  assistance  before  dis-\\nplacement, a dwelling that may reflect \\nsimilar government housing assistance. \\nIn  such  cases  any  requirements  of  the \\ngovernment  housing  assistance  pro-\\ngram  relating  to  the  size  of  the  re-\\nplacement  dwelling  shall  apply.

The Federal \\nAgency may also apply sanctions in ac-\\ncordance  with  applicable  program  reg-\\nulations. (Also see § 24.603, of this part). \\n(c) Prevention of fraud, waste, and mis-\\nmanagement.

In  the  case  of  a \\npartial  acquisition,  the  compensation \\nfor the real property to be acquired and \\nthe  compensation  for  damages,  if  any, \\nto the remaining real property shall be \\nseparately stated. \\n\\n(2) A description and location identi-\\nfication of the real property and the in-\\nterest  in  the  real  property  to  be  ac-\\nquired. \\n\\n(3) An identification of the buildings, \\nstructures,  and  other  improvements \\n(including  removable  building  equip-\\nment  and  trade  fixtures)  which  are  in-\\ncluded as part of the offer of just com-\\npensation.  Where  appropriate, \\nthe \\nstatement shall identify any other sep-\\narately  held  ownership  interest  in  the \\nproperty, e.g., a tenant-owned improve-\\nment,  and  indicate  that  such  interest \\nis not covered by this offer. \\n\\n(f)  Basic  negotiation  procedures.

The  owner  shall  be  given  rea-\\nsonable  opportunity  to  consider  the \\noffer  and  present  material  which  the \\nowner  believes  is  relevant  to  deter-\\nmining the value of the property and to \\nsuggest  modification  in  the  proposed \\nterms  and  conditions  of  the  purchase. \\nThe  Agency  shall  consider  the  owner’s \\npresentation. \\nA, \\n(See \\n§ 24.102(f).) \\n\\nappendix \\n\\n(g) Updating offer of just compensation. \\nIf  the  information  presented  by  the \\nowner,  or  a  material  change  in  the \\ncharacter or condition of the property, \\nindicates the need for new appraisal in-\\nformation, or if a significant delay has \\noccurred  since  the  time  of  the  ap-\\npraisal(s)  of  the  property,  the  Agency \\nshall  have  the  appraisal(s)  updated  or \\nobtain  a  new  appraisal(s).  If  the  latest \\nappraisal  information  indicates  that  a \\nchange  in  the  purchase  offer  is  war-\\nranted,  the  Agency  shall  promptly  re-\\nestablish  just  compensation  and  offer \\nthat amount to the owner in writing. \\n\\n(h)  Coercive  action.  The  Agency  shall \\nnot advance the time of condemnation, \\nor  defer  negotiations  or  condemnation \\nor  the  deposit  of  funds  with  the  court, \\nor  take  any  other  coercive  action  in \\norder  to  induce  an  agreement  on  the \\nprice to be paid for the property. \\n\\n(i)  Administrative  settlement.  The  pur-\\nchase  price  for  the  property  may  ex-\\nceed  the  amount  offered  as  just  com-\\npensation  when  reasonable  efforts  to \\nnegotiate  an  agreement  at \\nthat \\namount  have  failed  and  an  authorized \\nAgency official approves such adminis-\\ntrative settlement as being reasonable, \\nprudent,  and  in  the  public  interest. \\nWhen  Federal  funds  pay  for  or  partici-\\npate in acquisition costs, a written jus-\\ntification  shall  be  prepared,  which \\nstates  what  available  information,  in-\\ncluding trial risks, supports such a set-\\ntlement.

During  the \\nearly stages of development, an Agency \\nshall  plan  Federal  and  federally-as-\\nsisted  programs  or  projects  in  such  a \\nmanner  that  recognizes  the  problems \\nassociated with the displacement of in-\\ndividuals,  families,  businesses,  farms, \\nand  nonprofit  organizations  and  de-\\nvelop  solutions  to  minimize  the  ad-\\nverse  impacts  of  displacement.  Such \\nplanning,  where  appropriate,  shall  pre-\\ncede  any  action  by  an  Agency  which \\nwill  cause  displacement,  and  should  be \\nscoped to the complexity and nature of \\nthe  anticipated  displacing  activity  in-\\ncluding  an  evaluation  of  program  re-\\nsources  available  to  carry  out  timely \\nand  orderly  relocations.  Planning  may \\ninvolve  a  relocation  survey  or  study, \\nwhich may include the following: \\n\\n(1)  An  estimate  of  the  number  of \\nhouseholds  to  be  displaced  including \\ninformation  such  as  owner/tenant  sta-\\ntus, estimated value and rental rates of \\nproperties  to  be  acquired,  family  char-\\nacteristics,  and  special  consideration \\nof the impacts on minorities, the elder-\\nly, large families, and persons with dis-\\nabilities when applicable. \\n\\n(2)  An  estimate  of  the  number  of \\ncomparable  replacement  dwellings  in \\nthe  area  (including  price  ranges  and \\nrental  rates)  that  are  expected  to  be \\navailable  to  fulfill  the  needs  of  those \\nhouseholds  displaced.  When  an  ade-\\nquate  supply  of  comparable  housing  is \\nnot expected to be available, the Agen-\\ncy  should  consider  housing  of  last  re-\\nsort actions. \\n\\n(3)  An  estimate  of  the  number,  type \\nand  size  of  the  businesses,  farms,  and \\nnonprofit organizations to be displaced \\nand  the  approximate  number  of  em-\\nployees that may be affected. \\n\\n(4) An estimate of the availability of \\nreplacement  business  sites.  When  an \\nadequate  supply  of  replacement  busi-\\nness  sites  is  not  expected  to  be  avail-\\nable,  the  impacts  of  displacing  the \\nbusinesses should be considered and ad-\\ndressed.  Planning  for  displaced  busi-\\nnesses  which  are  reasonably  expected \\nto  involve  complex  or  lengthy  moving \\nprocesses or small businesses with lim-\\nited  financial  resources  and/or  few  al-\\nternative  relocation  sites  should  in-\\nclude  an  analysis  of  business  moving \\nproblems. \\n\\n(5)  Consideration  of  any  special  relo-\\ncation  advisory  services  that  may  be \\nnecessary  from  the  displacing  Agency \\nand other cooperating Agencies. \\n\\n(b) Loans for planning and preliminary \\nexpenses.  In  the  event  that  an  Agency \\nelects to consider using the duplicative \\nprovision in section 215 of the Uniform \\nAct  which  permits  the  use  of  project \\nfunds  for  loans  to  cover  planning  and \\nother  preliminary  expenses  for  the  de-\\nvelopment  of  additional  housing,  the \\nLead Agency will establish criteria and \\nprocedures  for  such  use  upon  the  re-\\nquest  of  the  Federal  Agency  funding \\nthe program or project. \\n\\n(c)  Relocation  assistance  advisory  serv-\\nices—(1)  General.  The  Agency  shall \\ncarry  out  a  relocation  assistance  advi-\\nsory  program  which  satisfies  the  re-\\nquirements  of  Title  VI  of  the  Civil \\nRights  Act  of  1964  (42  U.S.C.  2000d  et \\nseq.), Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act \\nof 1968 (42 U.S.C. 3601 et seq.), and Exec-\\nutive  Order  11063  (27  FR  11527,  Novem-\\nber  24,  1962),  and  offer  the  services  de-\\nscribed  in  paragraph  (c)(2)  of  this  sec-\\ntion.  If  the  Agency  determines  that  a \\nperson  occupying  property  adjacent  to \\nthe  real  property  acquired  for  the \\nproject  is  caused  substantial  economic \\ninjury  because  of  such  acquisition,  it \\nmay  offer  advisory  services  to  such \\nperson. \\n\\n(2)  Services  to  be  provided.

(See  § 24.2(a)(8).)  If  such  an \\ninspection  is  not  made,  the  Agency \\nshall  notify  the  person  to  be  displaced \\nthat  a  replacement  housing  payment \\nmay  not  be  made  unless  the  replace-\\nment  dwelling \\nin-\\nspected  and  determined  to  be  decent, \\nsafe, and sanitary. \\n\\nis  subsequently \\n\\n(D)  Whenever  possible,  minority  per-\\nsons shall be given reasonable opportu-\\nnities  to  relocate  to  decent,  safe,  and \\nsanitary replacement dwellings, not lo-\\ncated in an area of minority concentra-\\ntion,  that  are  within  their  financial \\nmeans.  This  policy,  however,  does  not \\nrequire  an  Agency  to  provide  a  person \\na  larger  payment  than  is  necessary  to \\nenable  a  person  to  relocate  to  a  com-\\nparable  replacement  dwelling.

Any \\nperson  who  occupies  the  real  property \\nand  is  not  in  unlawful  occupancy  on \\nthe  date  of  the  initiation  of  negotia-\\ntions, is presumed to be entitled to re-\\nlocation payments and other assistance \\nset forth in this part unless the Agency \\ndetermines that: \\n\\n(1)  The  person  received  an  eviction \\nnotice  prior  to  the  initiation  of  nego-\\ntiations  and,  as  a  result  of  that  notice \\nis later evicted; or \\n\\n(2) The person is evicted after the ini-\\ntiation  of  negotiations  for  serious  or \\nrepeated violation of material terms of \\nthe lease or occupancy agreement;  and \\n(3) In either case the eviction was not \\nundertaken  for  the  purpose  of  evading \\nthe  obligation  to  make  available  the \\npayments  and  other  assistance  set \\nforth in this part. \\n\\n(b) For purposes of determining eligi-\\nbility  for  relocation  payments,  the \\n\\ndate  of  displacement  is  the  date  the \\nperson  moves,  or  if  later,  the  date  a \\ncomparable  replacement  dwelling  is \\nmade  available.

The upper limit of a \\nreplacement  housing  payment  shall  be \\nbased  on  the  cost  of  a  comparable  re-\\nat \\nplacement \\n§ 24.2(a)(6)). \\n\\ndwelling \\n\\n(defined \\n\\n(1)  If  available,  at  least  three  com-\\nparable  replacement  dwellings  shall  be \\nexamined  and  the  payment  computed \\non the basis of the dwelling most near-\\nly  representative  of,  and  equal  to,  or \\nbetter than, the displacement dwelling. \\n(2)  If  the  site  of  the  comparable  re-\\nplacement dwelling lacks a major exte-\\nrior  attribute  of  the  displacement \\ndwelling  site,  (e.g.,  the  site  is  signifi-\\ncantly  smaller  or  does  not  contain  a \\nswimming  pool),  the  value  of  such  at-\\ntribute shall be subtracted from the ac-\\nquisition  cost  of  the  displacement \\ndwelling for purposes of computing the \\npayment. \\n\\n(3) If the acquisition of a portion of a \\ntypical  residential  property  causes  the \\ndisplacement  of  the  owner  from  the \\ndwelling  and  the  remainder \\nis  a \\nbuildable  residential  lot,  the  Agency \\nmay  offer  to  purchase  the  entire  prop-\\nerty. If the owner refuses to sell the re-\\nmainder to the Agency, the fair market \\nvalue of the remainder may be added to \\nthe  acquisition  cost  of  the  displace-\\nment  dwelling  for  purposes  of  com-\\nputing  the  replacement  housing  pay-\\nment. \\n\\n(4) To the extent feasible, comparable \\nreplacement dwellings shall be selected \\nfrom  the  neighborhood  in  which  the \\ndisplacement  dwelling  was  located  or, \\nif  that  is  not  possible,  in  nearby  or \\n\\nsimilar  neighborhoods  where  housing \\ncosts are generally the same or higher. \\n(5)  Multiple  occupants  of  one  dis-\\nplacement dwelling. If two or more oc-\\ncupants  of  the  displacement  dwelling \\nmove  to  separate  replacement  dwell-\\nings, each occupant is entitled to a rea-\\nsonable  prorated  share,  as  determined \\nby  the  Agency,  of  any  relocation  pay-\\nments  that  would  have  been  made  if \\nthe  occupants  moved  together  to  a \\ndwelling. \\ncomparable \\nHowever,  if  the  Agency  determines \\nthat  two  or  more  occupants  main-\\ntained  separate  households  within  the \\nsame  dwelling,  such  occupants  have \\nseparate  entitlements  to  relocation \\npayments. \\n\\nreplacement \\n\\n(6)  Deductions  from  relocation  pay-\\nments.  An  Agency  shall  deduct  the \\namount of any advance relocation pay-\\nment  from  the  relocation  payment(s) \\nto  which  a  displaced  person  is  other-\\nwise  entitled.  The  Agency  shall  not \\nwithhold  any  part  of  a  relocation  pay-\\nment  to  a  displaced  person  to  satisfy \\nan obligation to any other creditor. \\n\\n(7)  Mixed-use  and  multifamily  prop-\\nerties.  If  the  displacement  dwelling \\nwas  part  of  a  property  that  contained \\nanother dwelling unit and/or space used \\nfor  nonresidential  purposes,  and/or  is \\nlocated on a lot larger than typical for \\nresidential  purposes,  only  that  portion \\nof the acquisition payment which is ac-\\ntually attributable to the displacement \\ndwelling  shall  be  considered  the  acqui-\\nsition  cost  when  computing  the  re-\\nplacement housing payment. \\n\\n(b)  Inspection  of  replacement  dwelling. \\nBefore  making  a  replacement  housing \\npayment  or  releasing  the  initial  pay-\\nment  from  escrow,  the  Agency  or  its \\ndesignated  representative  shall  inspect \\nthe  replacement  dwelling  and  deter-\\nmine  whether  it  is  a  decent,  safe,  and \\nsanitary  dwelling  as  defined  at \\n§ 24.2(a)(8). \\n\\n(c) Purchase of replacement dwelling.

While it need not possess every \\nfeature  of  the  displacement  dwelling,  the \\nprincipal features must be present. \\n\\nFor  example,  if  the  displacement  dwelling \\ncontains  a  pantry  and  a  similar  dwelling  is \\nnot  available,  a  replacement  dwelling  with \\nample kitchen cupboards may be acceptable. \\nInsulated and heated space in a garage might \\nprove  an  adequate  substitute  for  basement \\nworkshop  space.  A  dining  area  may  sub-\\nstitute  for  a  separate  dining  room.  Under \\nsome  circumstances,  attic  space  could  sub-\\nstitute  for  basement  space  for  storage  pur-\\nposes, and vice versa. \\n\\nOnly in unusual circumstances may a com-\\nparable  replacement  dwelling  contain  fewer \\nrooms  or,  consequentially,  less  living  space \\nthan  the  displacement  dwelling.  Such  may \\nbe the case when a decent, safe, and sanitary \\nreplacement dwelling (which by definition is \\n‘‘adequate  to  accommodate’’  the  displaced \\nperson)  may  be  found  to  be  ‘‘functionally \\nequivalent’’  to  a  larger  but  very  run-down \\nsubstandard  displacement  dwelling.  Another \\nexample  is  when  a  displaced  person  accepts \\nan  offer  of  government  housing  assistance \\nand  the  applicable  requirements  of  such \\nhousing  assistance  program  require  that  the \\ndisplaced  person  occupy  a  dwelling  that  has \\nfewer rooms or less living space than the dis-\\nplacement dwelling. \\n\\nSection 24.2(a)(6)(vii). The definition of com-\\nparable replacement dwelling requires that a \\ncomparable  replacement  dwelling  for  a  per-\\nson  who  is  not  receiving  assistance  under \\nany government housing program before dis-\\nplacement  must  be  currently  available  on \\nthe  private  market  without  any  subsidy \\nunder a government housing program. \\n\\nSection  24.2(a)(6)(ix).  A  public  housing  unit \\nmay  qualify  as  a  comparable  replacement \\ndwelling  only  for  a  person  displaced  from  a \\npublic  housing  unit.  A  privately  owned \\ndwelling  with  a  housing  program  subsidy \\ntied to the unit may qualify as a comparable \\nreplacement  dwelling  only  for  a  person  dis-\\nplaced  from  a  similarly  subsidized  unit  or \\npublic housing. \\n\\nA  housing  program  subsidy  that  is  paid  to \\na person (not tied to the building), such as a \\nHUD  Section  8  Housing  Voucher  Program, \\nmay be reflected in an offer of a comparable \\nreplacement dwelling to a person receiving a \\nsimilar  subsidy  or  occupying  a  privately \\nowned subsidized unit or public housing unit \\nbefore displacement. \\n\\nHowever, nothing in this part prohibits an \\nAgency  from  offering,  or  precludes  a  person \\nfrom  accepting,  assistance  under  a  govern-\\nment housing program, even if the person did \\nnot  receive  similar  assistance  before  dis-\\nplacement. However, the Agency is obligated \\nto  inform  the  person  of  his  or  her  options \\nunder  this  part.  (If  a  person  accepts  assist-\\nance under a government housing assistance \\nprogram,  the  rules  of  that  program  gov-\\nerning the size of the dwelling apply, and the \\n\\nrental  assistance  payment  under  § 24.402 \\nwould  be  computed  on  the  basis  of  the  per-\\nson’s  actual  out-of-pocket  cost  for  the  re-\\nplacement housing.) \\n\\nSection  24.2(a)(8)(ii)  Decent,  Safe  and  Sani-\\ntary.  Many  local  housing  and  occupancy \\ncodes require the abatement of deteriorating \\npaint,  including  lead-based  paint  and  lead- \\nbased  paint  dust,  in  protecting  the  public \\nhealth  and  safety.  Where  such  standards \\nexist,  they  must  be  honored.  Even  where \\nlocal  law  does  not  mandate  adherence  to \\nsuch  standards,  it  is  strongly  recommended \\nthat they be considered as a matter of public \\npolicy. \\n\\nreasonable \\n\\nSection  24.2(a)(8)(vii)  Persons  with  a  dis-\\nability.  Reasonable  accommodation  of  a  dis-\\nplaced  person  with  a  disability  at  the  re-\\nplacement  dwelling  means  the  Agency  is  re-\\nquired to address persons with a physical im-\\npairment  that  substantially  limits  one  or \\nmore  of  the  major  life  activities.  In  these \\nsituations, \\naccommodation \\nshould  include  the  following  at  a  minimum: \\nDoors  of  adequate  width;  ramps  or  other  as-\\nsistance devices to traverse stairs and access \\nbathtubs,  shower  stalls,  toilets  and  sinks; \\nstorage  cabinets,  vanities,  sink  and  mirrors \\nat appropriate heights. Kitchen accommoda-\\ntions will include sinks and storage cabinets \\nbuilt  at  appropriate  heights  for  access.  The \\nAgency  shall  also  consider  other  items  that \\nmay be necessary, such as physical modifica-\\ntion  to  a  unit,  based  on  the  displaced  per-\\nson’s needs. \\n\\nSection 24.2(a)(9)(ii)(D) Persons not displaced. \\nParagraph  (a)(9)(ii)(D)  of  this  section  recog-\\nnizes that there are circumstances where the \\nacquisition,  rehabilitation  or  demolition  of \\nreal property takes place without the intent \\nor  necessity  that  an  occupant  of  the  prop-\\nerty be permanently displaced. Because such \\noccupants are not considered ‘‘displaced per-\\nsons’’ under this part, great care must be ex-\\nercised to ensure that they are treated fairly \\nand equitably. For example, if the tenant-oc-\\ncupant  of  a  dwelling  will  not  be  displaced, \\nbut  is  required  to  relocate  temporarily  in \\nconnection with the project, the temporarily \\noccupied  housing  must  be  decent,  safe,  and \\nsanitary  and  the  tenant  must  be  reimbursed \\nfor  all  reasonable  out-of-pocket  expenses  in-\\ncurred in connection with the temporary re-\\nlocation.  These  expenses  may  include  mov-\\ning  expenses  and  increased  housing  costs \\nduring the temporary relocation. Temporary \\nrelocation  should  not  extend  beyond  one \\nyear  before  the  person  is  returned  to  his  or \\nher  previous  unit  or  location.  The  Agency \\nmust contact any residential tenant who has \\nbeen  temporarily  relocated  for  a  period  be-\\nyond  one  year  and  offer  all  permanent  relo-\\ncation  assistance.  This  assistance  would  be \\nin  addition  to  any  assistance  the  person  has \\nalready  received  for  temporary  relocation, \\nand  may  not  be  reduced  by  the  amount  of \\nany temporary relocation assistance. \\n\\n216 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00226 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cOffice of the Secretary of Transportation \\n\\nPt. 24, App. A \\n\\nSimilarly,  if  a  business  will  be  shut-down \\nfor  any  length  of  time  due  to  rehabilitation \\nof  a  site,  it  may  be  temporarily  relocated \\nand  reimbursed  for  all  reasonable  out  of \\npocket expenses or must be determined to be \\ndisplaced at the Agency’s option. \\n\\nAny  person  who  disagrees  with  the  Agen-\\ncy’s  determination  that  he  or  she  is  not  a \\ndisplaced  person  under  this  part  may  file  an \\nappeal  in  accordance  with  49  CFR  part  24.10 \\nof this regulation. \\n\\nSection 24.2(a)(11) Dwelling Site. This defini-\\ntion  ensures  that  the  computation  of  re-\\nplacement  housing  payments  are  accurate \\nand realistic (a) when the dwelling is located \\non a larger than normal site, (b) when mixed- \\nuse  properties  are  acquired,  (c)  when  more \\nthan one dwelling is located on the acquired \\nproperty, or (d) when the replacement dwell-\\ning is retained by an owner and moved to an-\\nother site. \\n\\nSection  24.2(a)(14)  Household  income  (exclu-\\nsions). Household income for purposes of this \\nregulation does not include program benefits \\nthat  are  not  considered  income  by  Federal \\nlaw  such  as  food  stamps  and  the  Women  In-\\nfants  and  Children  (WIC)  program.  For  a \\nmore  detailed  list  of  income  exclusions  see \\nFederal  Highway  Administration,  Office  of \\nReal  Estate  Services  Web  site:  http:// \\n(FR  4644–N–16 \\nwww.fhwa.dot.gov/realestate/. \\npage 20319 Updated.) If there is a question on \\nwhether or not to include income from a spe-\\ncific  program  contact  the  Federal  Agency \\nadministering the program. \\n\\nSection  24(a)(15)  Initiation  of  negotiations. \\nThis section provides a special definition for \\nacquisition  and  displacements under Pub. L. \\n96–510  or  Superfund.  The  order  of  activities \\nunder  Superfund  may  differ  slightly  in  that \\ntemporary  relocation  may  precede  acquisi-\\ntion.  Superfund  is  a  program  designed  to \\nclean up hazardous waste sites. When such a \\nsite  is  discovered,  it  may  be  necessary,  in \\ncertain  limited  circumstances,  to  alert  indi-\\nvidual  owners  and  tenants  to  potential \\nhealth or safety threats and to offer to tem-\\nporarily  relocate  them  while  additional  in-\\nformation  is  gathered.  If  a  decision  is  later \\nmade  to  permanently  relocate  such  persons, \\nthose  who  had  been  temporarily  relocated \\nunder  Superfund  authority  would  no  longer \\nbe on site when a formal, written offer to ac-\\nquire the property was made, and thus would \\nlose their eligibility for a replacement hous-\\ning payment. In order to prevent this unfair \\noutcome,  we  have  provided  a  definition  of \\ninitiation  of  negotiation,  which  is  based  on \\nthe  date  the  Federal  Government  offers  to \\ntemporarily  relocate  an  owner  or  tenant \\nfrom the subject property. \\n\\nSection  24.2(a)(15)(iv)  Initiation  of  negotia-\\ntions (Tenants.) Tenants who occupy property \\nthat  may  be  acquired  amicably,  without  re-\\ncourse to the use of the power of eminent do-\\nmain, must be fully informed as to their eli-\\ngibility  for  relocation  assistance.  This  in-\\n\\ncludes notifying such tenants of their poten-\\ntial  eligibility  when  negotiations  are  initi-\\nated, notifying them if they become fully eli-\\ngible,  and,  in  the  event  the  purchase  of  the \\nproperty will not occur, notifying them that \\nthey  are  no  longer  eligible  for  relocation \\nbenefits. If a tenant is not readily accessible, \\nas the result of a disaster or emergency, the \\nAgency must make a good faith effort to pro-\\nvide these notifications and document its ef-\\nforts in writing. \\n\\nSection  24.2(a)(17)  Mobile  home.  The  fol-\\nlowing examples provide additional guidance \\non  the  types  of  mobile  homes  and  manufac-\\ntured  housing  that  can  be  found  acceptable \\nas comparable replacement dwellings for per-\\nsons  displaced  from  mobile  homes.  A  rec-\\nreational vehicle that is capable of providing \\nliving  accommodations  may  be  considered  a \\nreplacement  dwelling  if  the  following  cri-\\nteria  are  met:  the  recreational  vehicle  is \\npurchased  and  occupied  as  the  ‘‘primary’’ \\nplace  of  residence;  it  is  located  on  a  pur-\\nchased  or  leased  site  and  connected  to  or \\nhave  available  all  necessary  utilities  for \\nfunctioning as a housing unit on the date of \\nthe  displacing  Agency’s  inspection;  and,  the \\ndwelling, as sited, meets all local, State, and \\nFederal  requirements  for  a  decent,  safe  and \\nsanitary  dwelling.  (The  regulations  of  some \\nlocal  jurisdictions  will  not  permit  the  con-\\nsideration  of  these  vehicles  as  decent,  safe \\nand  sanitary  dwellings.  In  those  cases,  the \\nrecreational vehicle will not qualify as a re-\\nplacement dwelling.) \\n\\nFor HUD programs, mobile home is defined \\nas ‘‘a structure, transportable in one or more \\nsections,  which,  in  the  traveling  mode,  is \\neight  body  feet  or  more  in  width  or  forty \\nbody feet or more in length, or, when erected \\non site, is three hundred or more square feet, \\nand  which  is  built  on  a  permanent  chassis \\nand designed to be used as a dwelling with or \\nwithout  a  permanent  foundation  when  con-\\nnected  to  the  required  utilities  and  includes \\nthe  plumbing,  heating,  air-conditioning,  and \\nelectrical  systems  contained  therein;  except \\nthat  such  terms  shall  include  any  structure \\nwhich  meets  all  the  requirements  of  this \\nparagraph  except  the  size  requirements  and \\nwith respect to which the manufacturer vol-\\nuntarily  files  a  certification  required  by  the \\nSecretary  of  HUD  and  complies  with  the \\nstandards  established  under  the  National \\nManufactured  Housing  Construction  and \\nSafety  Standards  Act,  provided  by  Congress \\nin  the  original  1974  Manufactured  Housing \\nAct.’’  In  1979  the  term  ‘‘mobile  home’’  was \\nchanged  to  ‘‘manufactured  home.’’  For  pur-\\nposes  of  this  regulation,  the  terms  mobile \\nhome  and  manufactured  home  are  synony-\\nmous. \\n\\nWhen  assembled,  manufactured  homes \\nbuilt  after  1976  contain  no  less  than  320 \\n\\n217 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00227 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cPt. 24, App. A \\n\\n49 CFR Subtitle A (10–1–21 Edition) \\n\\nsquare feet.

The  Agency  is  not  re-\\nquired  to  conduct  an  exhaustive  search  for \\nsuch  other  payments;  it  is  only  required  to \\navoid  creating  a  duplication  based  on  the \\nAgency’s  knowledge  at  the  time  a  payment \\nis computed. \\n\\nSUBPART B—REAL PROPERTY ACQUISITION \\n\\nFederal  Agencies  may  find  that,  for  Fed-\\neral  eminent  domain  purposes,  the  terms \\n‘‘fair market value’’ (as used throughout this \\nsubpart)  and  ‘‘market  value,’’  which  may  be \\nthe  more  typical  term  in  private  trans-\\nactions, may be synonymous. \\n\\nSection  24.101(a)  Direct  Federal  program  or \\nproject.  All  49  CFR  Part  24  Subpart  B  (real \\nproperty  acquisition)  requirements  apply  to \\nall  direct  acquisitions  for  Federal  programs \\nand projects by Federal Agencies, except for \\nacquisitions  undertaken  by  the  Tennessee \\nValley Authority or the Rural Utilities Serv-\\nice.  There  are  no  exceptions  for  ‘‘voluntary \\ntransactions.’’ \\n\\nSection 24.101(b)(1)(i). The term ‘‘general ge-\\nographic  area’’  is  used  to  clarify  that  the \\n‘‘geographic  area’’  is  not  to  be  construed  to \\nbe a small, limited area. \\n\\nSections 24.101(b)(1)(iv) and (2)(ii). These sec-\\ntions provide that, for programs and projects \\nreceiving  Federal  financial  assistance  de-\\nscribed  in  §§ 24.101(b)(1)  and  (2),  Agencies  are \\nto  inform  the  owner(s)  in  writing  of  the \\nAgency’s  estimate  of  the  fair  market  value \\nfor the property to be acquired. \\n\\nWhile  this  part  does  not  require  an  ap-\\npraisal for these transactions, Agencies may \\nstill decide that an appraisal is necessary to \\nsupport  their  determination  of  the  market \\nvalue  of  these  properties,  and,  in  any  event, \\nAgencies  must  have  some  reasonable  basis \\nfor  their  determination  of  market  value.  In \\naddition,  some  of  the  concepts  inherent  in \\nFederal  Program  appraisal  practice  are  ap-\\npropriate for these estimates. It would be ap-\\npropriate  for  Agencies  to  adhere  to  project \\ninfluence  restrictions,  as  well  as  guard \\nagainst  discredited  ‘‘public  interest  value’’ \\nvaluation concepts. \\n\\nAfter  an  Agency  has  established  an \\namount it believes to be the market value of \\n\\nthe  property  and  has  notified  the  owner  of \\nthis  amount  in  writing,  an  Agency  may  ne-\\ngotiate  freely  with  the  owner  in  order  to \\nreach  agreement.  Since  these  transactions \\nare  voluntary,  accomplished  by  a  willing \\nbuyer and a willing  seller, negotiations may \\nresult  in  agreement  for  the  amount  of  the \\noriginal  estimate,  an  amount  exceeding  it, \\nor  for  a  lesser  amount.  Although  not  re-\\nquired  by  the  regulations,  it  would  be  en-\\ntirely  appropriate  for  Agencies  to  apply  the \\nadministrative  settlement  concept  and  pro-\\ncedures  in  § 24.102(i)  to  negotiate  amounts \\nthat  exceed  the  original  estimate  of  market \\nvalue.  Agencies  shall  not  take  any  coercive \\naction  in  order  to  reach  agreement  on  the \\nprice to be paid for the property. \\n\\nSection  24.101(c)  Less-than-full-fee  interest  in \\nreal  property.  This  provision  provides  a \\nbenchmark  beyond  which  the  requirements \\nof the subpart clearly apply to leases. \\n\\nSection  24.102(c)(2)  Appraisal,  waiver  thereof, \\nand  invitation  to  owner.  The  purpose  of  the \\nappraisal  waiver  provision  is  to  provide \\nAgencies  a  technique  to  avoid  the  costs  and \\ntime delay associated with appraisal require-\\nments  for  low-value,  non-complex  acquisi-\\ntions.  The  intent  is  that  non-appraisers \\nmake the waiver valuations, freeing apprais-\\ners to do more sophisticated work. \\n\\nThe  Agency  employee  making  the  deter-\\nmination to use the appraisal waiver process \\nmust  have  enough  understanding  of  ap-\\npraisal  principles  to  be  able  to  determine \\nwhether  or  not  the  proposed  acquisition  is \\nlow value and uncomplicated. \\n\\nWaiver valuations are not appraisals as de-\\nfined  by  the  Uniform  Act  and  these  regula-\\ntions;  therefore,  appraisal  performance  re-\\nquirements  or  standards,  regardless  of  their \\nsource,  are  not  required  for  waiver  valu-\\nations  by  this  rule.  Since  waiver  valuations \\nare not appraisals, neither is there a require-\\nment  for  an  appraisal  review.  However,  the \\nAgency must have a reasonable basis for the \\nwaiver  valuation  and  an  Agency  official \\nmust still establish an amount believed to be \\njust  compensation  to  offer  the  property \\nowner(s). \\n\\nThe  definition  of  ‘‘appraisal’’  in  the  Uni-\\nform  Act  and  appraisal  waiver  provisions  of \\nthe  Uniform  Act  and  these  regulations  are \\nFederal  law  and  public  policy  and  should  be \\nconsidered as such when determining the im-\\npact of appraisal requirements levied by oth-\\ners. \\n\\nSection 24.102(d) Establishment of offer of just \\ncompensation.  The  initial  offer  to  the  prop-\\nerty owner may not be less than the amount \\nof the Agency’s approved appraisal, but may \\nexceed  that  amount  if  the  Agency  deter-\\nmines  that  a  greater  amount  reflects  just \\ncompensation for the property. \\n\\nSection 24.102(f) Basic negotiation procedures. \\nAn  offer  should  be  adequately  presented  to \\nan  owner,  and  the  owner  should  be  properly \\nface-to-face  contact \\ninformed.

In \\norder  to  satisfy  this  requirement,  Agencies \\nmust  allow  owners  time  for  analysis,  re-\\nsearch  and  development,  and  compilation  of \\na  response,  including  perhaps  getting  an  ap-\\npraisal.  The  needed  time  can  vary  signifi-\\ncantly,  depending  on  the  circumstances,  but \\nthirty  (30)  days  would  seem  to  be  the  min-\\nimum  time  these  actions  can  be  reasonably \\nexpected  to  require.  Regardless  of  project \\ntime  pressures,  property  owners  must  be  af-\\nforded this opportunity. \\n\\nIn  some  jurisdictions,  there  is  pressure  to \\ninitiate  formal  eminent  domain  procedures \\nat  the  earliest  opportunity  because  com-\\npleting  the  eminent  domain  process,  includ-\\ning  gaining  possession  of  the  needed  real \\nproperty, is very time consuming. These pro-\\nvisions are not intended to restrict this prac-\\ntice, so long as it does not interfere with the \\nreasonable  time  that  must  be  provided  for \\nnegotiations, described above, and the Agen-\\ncies  adhere  to  the  Uniform  Act  ban  on  coer-\\ncive  action  (section  301(7)  of  the  Uniform \\nAct). \\n\\nIf the owner expresses intent to provide an \\nappraisal report, Agencies are encouraged to \\nprovide  the  owner  and/or  his/her  appraiser  a \\ncopy  of  Agency  appraisal  requirements  and \\ninform  them  that  their  appraisal  should  be \\nbased on those requirements. \\n\\nSection  24.102(i)  Administrative  settlement. \\nThis  section  provides  guidance  on  adminis-\\ntrative  settlement  as  an  alternative  to  judi-\\ncial  resolution  of  a  difference  of  opinion  on \\nthe value of a property, in order to avoid un-\\nnecessary  litigation  and  congestion  in  the \\ncourts. \\n\\nAll  relevant \\n\\nfacts  and  circumstances \\nshould  be  considered  by  an  Agency  official \\ndelegated  this  authority.  Appraisers,  includ-\\ning review appraisers, must not be pressured \\nto adjust their estimate of value for the pur-\\npose of justifying such settlements. Such ac-\\ntion would invalidate the appraisal process. \\n\\nSection  24.102(j)  Payment  before  taking  pos-\\nsession.  It  is  intended  that  a  right-of-entry \\nfor construction purposes be obtained only in \\nthe  exceptional  case,  such  as  an  emergency \\nproject,  when  there  is  no  time  to  make  an \\nappraisal  and  purchase  offer  and  the  prop-\\nerty owner is agreeable to the process. \\n\\nSection  24.102(m)  Fair  rental.  Section  301(6) \\nof  the  Uniform  Act  limits  what  an  Agency \\nmay charge when a former owner or previous \\noccupant  of  a  property  is  permitted  to  rent \\nthe  property  for  a  short  term  or  when  occu-\\npancy is subject to termination by the Agen-\\ncy on short notice. Such rent may not exceed \\n‘‘the  fair  rental  value  of  the  property  to  a \\nshort-term  occupier.’’  Generally,  the  Agen-\\n\\ncy’s  right  to  terminate  occupancy  on  short \\nnotice  (whether  or  not  the  renter  also  has \\nthat  right)  supports  the  establishment  of  a \\nlesser  rental  than  might  be  found  in  a \\nlonger, fixed-term situation. \\n\\nSection  24.102(n)  Conflict  of  interest.  The \\noverall  objective  is  to  minimize  the  risk  of \\nfraud  while  allowing  Agencies  to  operate  as \\nefficiently as possible. There are three parts \\nto this provision. \\n\\nThe  first  provision  is  the  prohibition \\nagainst having any interest in the real prop-\\nerty being valued by the appraiser (for an ap-\\npraisal), the valuer (for a waiver estimate) or \\nthe  review  appraiser  (for  an  appraisal  re-\\nview.) \\n\\nThe  second  provision  is  that  no  person \\nfunctioning  as  a  negotiator  for  a  project  or \\nprogram  can  supervise  or  formally  evaluate \\nthe  performance  of  any  appraiser  or  review \\nappraiser  performing  appraisal  or  appraisal \\nreview work for that project or program. The \\nintent  of  this  provision  is  to  ensure  ap-\\npraisal/valuation  independence  and  to  pre-\\nvent  inappropriate  influence.  It  is  not  in-\\ntended  to  prevent  Agencies  from  providing \\nappraisers/valuers  with  appropriate  project \\ninformation  and  participating \\nin  deter-\\nmining the scope of work for the appraisal or \\nvaluation.  For  a  program  or  project  receiv-\\ning Federal financial assistance, the Federal \\nfunding Agency may waive this requirement \\nif it would create a hardship for the Agency. \\nThe  intent  is  to  accommodate  Federal-aid \\nrecipients that have a small staff where this \\nprovision would be unworkable. \\n\\nThe  third  provision  is  to  minimize  situa-\\ntions  where  administrative  costs  exceed  ac-\\nquisition  costs.  Section  24.102(n)  also  pro-\\nvides  that  the  same  person  may  prepare  a \\nvaluation  estimate  (including  an  appraisal) \\nand  negotiate  that  acquisition,  if  the  valu-\\nation  estimate  amount  is  $10,000  or  less. \\nHowever, it should be noted that this excep-\\ntion for properties valued at $10,000 or less is \\nnot  mandatory,  e.g.,  Agencies  are  not  re-\\nquired  to  use  those  who  prepare  a  waiver \\nvaluation or appraisal of $10,000 or less to ne-\\ngotiate  the  acquisition,  and,  all  appraisals \\nmust be reviewed in accordance with § 24.104. \\nThis includes appraisals of real property val-\\nued at $10,000 or less. \\n\\nSection  24.103  Criteria  for  Appraisals.  The \\nterm ‘‘requirements’’ is used throughout this \\nsection  to  avoid  confusion  with  The  Ap-\\npraisal  Foundation’s  Uniform  Standards  of \\nProfessional  Appraisal  Practice  (USPAP) \\n‘‘standards.’’ Although this section discusses \\nappraisal  requirements,  the  definition  of \\n‘‘appraisal’’  itself  at  § 24.2(a)(3)  includes  ap-\\npraisal  performance  requirements  that  are \\nan inherent part of this section. \\n\\nThe  term  ‘‘Federal  and  federally-assisted \\nprogram  or  project’’  is  used  to  better  iden-\\ntify  the  type  of  appraisal  practices  that  are \\nto  be  referenced  and  to  differentiate  them \\n\\n219 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00229 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cPt. 24, App. A \\n\\n49 CFR Subtitle A (10–1–21 Edition) \\n\\nfrom the private sector, especially mortgage \\nlending, appraisal practice. \\n\\nSection  24.103(a)  Appraisal  requirements.  The \\nfirst sentence instructs readers that require-\\nments  for  appraisals  for  Federal  and  feder-\\nally-assisted  programs  or  projects  are  lo-\\ncated  in  49  CFR  part  24.  These  are  the  basic \\nappraisal  requirements  for  Federal  and  fed-\\nerally-assisted  programs  or  projects.  How-\\never,  Agencies  may  enhance  and  expand  on \\nthem,  and  there  may  be  specific  project  or \\nprogram legislation that references other ap-\\npraisal requirements. \\n\\nThese  appraisal  requirements  are  nec-\\nessarily  designed  to  comply  with  the  Uni-\\nform Act and other Federal eminent domain \\nbased  appraisal  requirements.  They  are  also \\nconsidered  to  be  consistent  with  Standards \\nRules  1,  2,  and  3  of  the  2004  edition  of  the \\nUSPAP. Consistency with USPAP has been a \\nfeature of these appraisal requirements since \\nthe  beginning  of  USPAP.  This  ‘‘consistent’’ \\nrelationship was more formally recognized in \\nOMB  Bulletin  92–06.  While  these  require-\\nments  are  considered  consistent  with \\nUSPAP,  neither  can  supplant  the  other; \\ntheir  provisions  are  neither  identical,  nor \\ninterchangeable.  Appraisals  performed  for \\nFederal  and  federally-assisted  real  property \\nacquisition  must  follow  the  requirements  in \\nthis  regulation.  Compliance  with  any  other \\nappraisal requirements is not the purview of \\nthis  regulation.  An  appraiser  who  is  com-\\nmitted  to  working  within  the  bounds  of \\nUSPAP  should  recognize  that  compliance \\nwith  both  USPAP  and  these  requirements \\nmay  be  achieved  by  using  the  Supplemental \\nStandards  Rule  and  the  Jurisdictional  Ex-\\nception Rule of USPAP, where applicable. \\n\\nThe term ‘‘scope of work’’ defines the gen-\\neral  parameters  of  the  appraisal.  It  reflects \\nthe  needs  of  the  Agency  and  the  require-\\nments  of  Federal  and  federally-assisted  pro-\\ngram  appraisal  practice.  It  should  be  devel-\\noped cooperatively by the assigned appraiser \\nand  an  Agency  official  who  is  competent  to \\nboth  represent  the  Agency’s  needs  and  re-\\nspect  valid  appraisal  practice.  The  scope  of \\nwork  statement  should  include  the  purpose \\nand/or function of the appraisal, a definition \\nof the estate being appraised, and if it is fair \\nmarket  value,  its  applicable  definition,  and \\nthe  assumptions  and  limiting  conditions  af-\\nfecting the appraisal. It may include param-\\neters  for  the  data  search  and  identification \\nof  the  technology,  including  approaches  to \\nvalue,  to  be  used  to  analyze  the  data.  The \\nscope of work should consider the specific re-\\nquirements  in  49  CFR  24.103(a)(2)(i)  through \\n(v) and address them as appropriate. \\n\\nSection  24.103(a)(1).  The  appraisal  report \\nshould  identify  the  items  considered  in  the \\nappraisal  to  be  real  property,  as  well  as \\nthose identified as personal property. \\n\\nSection  24.103(a)(2).  All  relevant  and  reli-\\nable approaches to value are to be used. How-\\never,  where  an  Agency  determines  that  the \\n\\nsales  comparison  approach  will  be  adequate \\nby  itself  and  yield  credible  appraisal  results \\nbecause  of  the  type  of  property  being  ap-\\npraised  and  the  availability  of  sales  data,  it \\nmay  limit  the  appraisal  assignment  to  the \\nsales  comparison  approach.  This  should  be \\nreflected in the scope of work. \\n\\nSection  24.103(b)  Influence  of  the  project  on \\njust compensation. As used in this section, the \\nterm ‘‘project’’ means an undertaking which \\nis planned, designed, and intended to operate \\nas a unit. \\n\\nWhen  the  public  is  aware  of  the  proposed \\nproject, project area property values may be \\naffected.  Therefore,  property  owners  should \\nnot  be  penalized  because  of  a  decrease  in \\nvalue  caused  by  the  proposed  project  nor \\nreap  a  windfall  at  public  expense  because  of \\nincreased  value  created  by  the  proposed \\nproject. \\n\\nSection  24.103(d)(1).  The  appraiser  and  re-\\nview  appraiser  must  each  be  qualified  and \\ncompetent  to  perform  the  appraisal  and  ap-\\npraisal  review  assignments,  respectively. \\nAmong  other  qualifications,  State  licensing \\nor certification and professional society des-\\nignations  can  help  provide  an  indication  of \\nan appraiser’s abilities. \\n\\nSection 24.104 Review of appraisals. The term \\n\\n‘‘review  appraiser’’  is  used  rather  than  ‘‘re-\\nviewing  appraiser,’’  to  emphasize  that  ‘‘re-\\nview  appraiser’’  is  a  separate  specialty  and \\nnot  just  an  appraiser  who  happens  to  be  re-\\nviewing  an  appraisal.  Federal  Agencies  have \\nlong  held  the  perspective  that  appraisal  re-\\nview is a unique skill that, while it certainly \\nbuilds on appraisal skills, requires more. The \\nreview  appraiser  should  possess  both  ap-\\npraisal  technical  abilities  and  the  ability  to \\nbe the two-way bridge between the Agency’s \\nreal  property  valuation  needs  and  the  ap-\\npraiser. \\n\\nAgency  review  appraisers  typically  per-\\nform  a  role  greater  than  technical  appraisal \\nreview.  They  are  often  involved  in  early \\nproject  development.  Later  they  may  be  in-\\nvolved  in  devising  the  scope  of  work  state-\\nments  and  participate  in  making  appraisal \\nassignments  to  fee  and/or  staff  appraisers. \\nThey  are  also  mentors  and  technical  advi-\\nsors,  especially  on  Agency  policy  and  re-\\nquirements, to appraisers, both staff and fee. \\nAdditionally,  review  appraisers  are \\nfre-\\nquently  technical  advisors  to  other  Agency \\nofficials. \\n\\nSection 24.104(a). This paragraph states that \\nthe review appraiser is to review the apprais-\\ner’s  presentation  and  analysis  of  market  in-\\nformation  and  that  it  is  to  be  reviewed \\nagainst  § 24.103  and  other  applicable  require-\\nments,  including,  to  the  extent  appropriate, \\nthe Uniform Appraisal Standards for Federal \\nLand Acquisition.

If  the  initial  appraisal  submitted \\nfor  review  is  not  acceptable,  the  review  ap-\\npraiser is to communicate and work with the \\nappraiser  to  the  greatest  extent  possible  to \\nfacilitate  the  appraiser’s  development  of  an \\nacceptable appraisal. \\n\\nIn doing this, the review appraiser is to re-\\nmain  in  an  advisory  role,  not  directing  the \\nappraisal,  and  retaining  objectivity  and  op-\\ntions for the appraisal review itself. \\n\\nIf the Agency intends that the staff review \\nappraiser approve the appraisal (as the basis \\nfor the establishment of the amount believed \\nto  be  just  compensation),  or  establish  the \\namount  the  Agency  believes  is  just  com-\\npensation,  she/he  must  be  specifically  au-\\nthorized  by  the  Agency  to  do  so.  If  the  re-\\nview  appraiser  is  not  specifically  authorized \\nto approve the appraisal (as the basis for the \\nestablishment  of  the  amount  believed  to  be \\njust  compensation),  or  establish  the  amount \\nbelieved  to  be  just  compensation,  that  au-\\nthority  remains  with  another  Agency  offi-\\ncial. \\n\\nSection  24.104(b).  In  developing  an  inde-\\npendent approved or recommended value, the \\nreview  appraiser  may  reference  any  accept-\\nable  resource,  including  acceptable  parts  of \\nany  appraisal,  including  an  otherwise  unac-\\nceptable  appraisal.  When  a  review  appraiser \\ndevelops an independent value, while retain-\\ning  the  appraisal  review,  that  independent \\nvalue also becomes the approved appraisal of \\nthe  fair  market  value  for  Uniform  Act  Sec-\\ntion 301(3) purposes. It is within Agency dis-\\ncretion to decide whether a second review is \\nneeded  if  the  first  review  appraiser  estab-\\nlishes  a  value  different  from  that  in  the  ap-\\npraisal report or reports on the property. \\n\\nSection  24.104(c).  Before  acceptance  of  an \\nappraisal,  the  review  appraiser  must  deter-\\nmine that the appraiser’s documentation, in-\\ncluding  valuation  data  and  analysis  of  that \\ndata,  demonstrates  the  soundness  of  the  ap-\\npraiser’s  opinion  of  value.  For  the  purposes \\nof  this  part,  an  acceptable  appraisal  is  any \\nappraisal that, on its own, meets the require-\\nments  of  § 24.103.  An  approved  appraisal  is \\nthe  one  acceptable  appraisal  that  is  deter-\\nmined  to  best  fulfill  the  requirement  to  be \\nthe  basis  for  the  amount  believed  to  be  just \\ncompensation.  Recognizing  that  appraisal  is \\nnot  an  exact  science,  there  may  be  more \\nthan  one  acceptable  appraisal  of  a  property, \\nbut for the purposes of this part, there can be \\nonly one approved appraisal. \\n\\nAt the Agency’s discretion, for a low value \\nproperty  requiring  only  a  simple  appraisal \\nprocess,  the  review  appraiser’s  recommenda-\\ntion  (or  approval),  endorsing  the  appraiser’s \\nreport,  may  be  determined  to  satisfy  the  re-\\nquirement  for  the  review  appraiser’s  signed \\nreport and certification. \\n\\nincidental \\n\\nSection  24.106(b).  Expenses \\n\\nto \\ntransfer  of  title  to  the  agency.  Generally,  the \\nAgency  is  able  to  pay  such  incidental  costs \\ndirectly and, where feasible, is required to do \\nso.  In  order  to  prevent  the  property  owner \\nfrom  making  unnecessary  out-of-pocket  ex-\\npenditures  and  to  avoid  duplication  of  ex-\\npenses,  the  property  owner  should  be  in-\\nformed  early  in  the  acquisition  process  of \\nthe  Agency’s  intent  to  make  such  arrange-\\nments.  Such  expenses  must  be  reasonable \\nand necessary. \\n\\nSUBPART C—GENERAL RELOCATION \\nREQUIREMENTS \\n\\nSection  24.202 Applicability  and  Section \\n205(c) Services to be provided. In extraordinary \\ncircumstances,  when  a  displaced  person  is \\nnot  readily  accessible,  the  Agency  must \\nmake  a  good  faith  effort  to  comply  with \\nthese  sections  and  document  its  efforts  in \\nwriting. \\n\\nSection  24.204 Availability  of  comparable  re-\\n\\nplacement dwelling before displacement. \\n\\nSection  24.204(a)  General.  This  provision  re-\\nquires  that  no  one  may  be  required  to  move \\nfrom  a  dwelling  without  a  comparable  re-\\nplacement  dwelling  having  been  made  avail-\\nable.  In  addition,  § 24.204(a)  requires  that, \\n‘‘where  possible,  three  or  more  comparable \\nreplacement  dwellings  shall  be  made  avail-\\nable.’’ Thus, the basic standard for the num-\\nber of referrals required under this section is \\nthree.  Only  in  situations  where  three  com-\\nparable replacement dwellings are not avail-\\nable  (e.g.,  when  the  local  housing  market \\ndoes  not  contain  three  comparable  dwell-\\nings) may the Agency make fewer than three \\nreferrals. \\n\\nSection 24.205 Relocation assistance advisory \\nservices. Section 24.205(c)(2)(ii)(D) emphasizes \\nthat  if  the  comparable  replacement  dwell-\\nings  are  located  in  areas  of  minority  con-\\ncentration,  minority  persons  should,  if  pos-\\nsible, also be given opportunities to relocate \\nto replacement dwellings not located in such \\nareas. \\n\\nSection  24.206 Eviction  for  cause.  An  evic-\\ntion  related  to  non-compliance  with  a  re-\\nquirement  related  to  carrying  out  a  project \\n(e.g.,  failure  to  move  or  relocate  when  in-\\nstructed,  or  to  cooperate  in  the  relocation \\nprocess)  shall  not  negate  a  person’s  entitle-\\nment  to  relocation  payments  and  other  as-\\nsistance set forth in this part. \\n\\nSection  24.207 General  Requirements–Claims \\nfor  relocation  payments.

Payment  for  Actual  Reason-\\n\\nable Moving and Related Expenses. \\n\\nSection  24.301(e)  Personal  property  only.  Ex-\\namples  of  personal  property  only  moves \\nmight  be:  personal  property  that  is  located \\non  a  portion  of  property  that  is  being  ac-\\nquired, but the business or residence will not \\nbe  taken  and  can  still  operate  after  the  ac-\\nquisition;  personal  property  that  is  located \\nin  a  mini-storage  facility  that  will  be  ac-\\nquired or relocated; personal property that is \\nstored on vacant land that is to be acquired. \\nFor  a  nonresidential  personal  property \\nonly  move,  the  owner  of  the  personal  prop-\\nerty  has  the  options  of  moving  the  personal \\nproperty  by  using  a  commercial  mover  or  a \\nself-move. \\n\\nIf a question arises concerning the reason-\\nableness  of  an  actual  cost  move,  the  acquir-\\ning Agency may obtain estimates from quali-\\nfied  movers  to  use  as  the  standard  in  deter-\\nmining the payment. \\n\\nSection  24.301  (g)(14)(i)  and  (ii).  If  the  piece \\nof  equipment  is  operational  at  the  acquired \\nsite,  the  estimated  cost  to  reconnect  the \\nequipment  shall  be  based  on  the  cost  to  in-\\nstall  the  equipment  as  it  currently  exists, \\nand  shall  not  include  the  cost  of  code-re-\\nquired  betterments  or  upgrades  that  may \\napply  at  the  replacement  site.  As  prescribed \\nin  the  regulation,  the  allowable  in-place \\nvalue  estimate  (§ 24.301(g)(14)(i))  and  moving \\ncost  estimate  (§ 24.301(g)(14)(ii))  must  reflect \\nonly the ‘‘as is’’ condition and installation of \\nthe  item  at  the  displacement  site.  The  in- \\nplace  value  estimate  may  not  include  costs \\nthat  reflect  code  or  other  requirements  that \\nwere  not  in  effect  at  the  displacement  site; \\nor  include  installation  costs  for  machinery \\nor  equipment  that  is  not  operable  or  not  in-\\nstalled at the displacement site. \\n\\nSection  24.301(g)(17)  Searching  expenses.  In \\nspecial  cases  where  the  displacing  Agency \\ndetermines  it  to  be  reasonable  and  nec-\\nessary,  certain  additional  categories  of \\nsearching  costs  may  be  considered  for  reim-\\nbursement.  These  include  those  costs  in-\\nvolved  in  investigating  potential  replace-\\nment  sites  and  the  time  of  the  business \\nowner,  based  on  salary  or  earnings,  required \\nto  apply  for  licenses  or  permits,  zoning \\n\\nchanges,  and  attendance  at  zoning  hearings. \\nNecessary  attorney  fees  required  to  obtain \\nsuch  licenses  or  permits  are  also  reimburs-\\nable. Time spent in negotiating the purchase \\nof  a  replacement  business  site  is  also  reim-\\nbursable  based  on  a  reasonable  salary  or \\nearnings  rate.  In  those  instances  when  such \\nadditional  costs  to  investigate  and  acquire \\nthe  site  exceed  $2,500,  the  displacing  Agency \\nmay  consider  waiver  of  the  cost  limitation \\nunder  the  § 24.7,  waiver  provision.  Such  a \\nwaiver  should  be  subject  to  the  approval  of \\nthe  Federal-funding  Agency  in  accordance \\nwith existing delegation authority. \\n\\nSection  24.303(b)  Professional  Services.  If  a \\n\\nquestion  should  arise  as  to  what  is  a  ‘‘rea-\\nsonable  hourly  rate,’’  the  Agency  should \\ncompare  the  rates  of  other  similar  profes-\\nsional providers in that area. \\n\\nSection 24.305 Fixed Payment for Moving Ex-\\n\\npenses—Nonresidential Moves. \\n\\nSection  24.305(d)  Nonprofit  organization. \\nGross  revenues  may  include  membership \\nfees,  class  fees,  cash  donations,  tithes,  re-\\nceipts  from  sales  or  other  forms  of  fund  col-\\nlection  that  enables  the  nonprofit  organiza-\\ntion to operate. Administrative expenses are \\nthose  for  administrative  support  such  as \\nrent,  utilities,  salaries,  advertising,  and \\nother  like  items  as  well  as  fundraising  ex-\\npenses.  Operating  expenses  for  carrying  out \\nthe  purposes  of  the  nonprofit  organization \\nare  not  included  in  administrative  expenses. \\nThe monetary receipts and expense amounts \\nmay  be  verified  with  certified  financial \\nstatements  or  financial  documents  required \\nby public Agencies. \\n\\nSection 24.305(e) Average annual net earnings \\nof a business or farm operation.

Any  reasonable  method \\nfor arriving at the fair market value may be \\nused. \\n\\nSection  24.401(d)  Increased  mortgage  interest \\ncosts.  The  provision  in  § 24.401(d)  sets  forth \\nthe factors to be used in computing the pay-\\nment  that  will  be  required  to  reduce  a  per-\\nson’s  replacement  mortgage  (added  to  the \\ndownpayment)  to  an  amount  which  can  be \\namortized at the same monthly payment for \\nprincipal  and  interest  over  the  same  period \\nof  time  as  the  remaining  term  on  the  dis-\\nplacement  mortgages.  This  payment  is  com-\\nmonly known as the ‘‘buydown.’’ \\n\\nThe  Agency  must  know  the  remaining \\nprincipal  balance,  the  interest  rate,  and \\nmonthly principal and interest payments for \\nthe old mortgage as well as the interest rate, \\npoints  and  term  for  the  new  mortgage  to \\ncompute  the  increased  mortgage  interest \\ncosts.  If  the  combination  of  interest  and \\npoints for the new mortgage exceeds the cur-\\nrent prevailing fixed interest rate and points \\nfor  conventional  mortgages  and  there  is  no \\njustification  for  the  excessive  rate,  then  the \\ncurrent  prevailing  fixed  interest  rate  and \\npoints  shall  be  used  in  the  computations. \\nJustification  may  be  the  unavailability  of \\nthe  current  prevailing  rate  due  to  the \\namount of the new mortgage, credit difficul-\\nties, or other similar reasons. \\n\\nSAMPLE COMPUTATION \\n\\nOld Mortgage: \\n\\nRemaining Principal Balance ..........\\nMonthly  Payment  (principal  and  in-\\nterest) ...........................................\\nInterest rate (percent) .....................\\n\\n$50,000 \\n\\n$458 .22 \\n7 \\n\\nNew Mortgage: \\n\\nInterest rate (percent) .....................\\nPoints ..............................................\\nTerm (years) ....................................\\n\\n10 \\n3 \\n15 \\n\\nRemaining term of the old mortgage is de-\\ntermined  to  be  174  months.

However,  if  it  is  shorter, \\nuse  the  term  of  the  new  mortgage  and  com-\\npute the needed monthly payment. \\n\\nAmount to be financed to maintain month-\\n\\nly payments of $458.22 at 10% = $42,010.18. \\n\\nCalculation: \\n\\nRemaining Principal Balance ..........\\nMinus  Monthly  Payment  (principal \\nand interest) .................................\\n\\n$50,000.00 \\n\\n¥42,010.18 \\n\\nIncreased mortgage interest costs ..\\n3 points on $42,010.18 ...................\\n\\n7,989.82 \\n1,260.31 \\n\\nTotal  buydown  necessary  to  main-\\ntain payments at $458.22/month\\n\\n9,250.13 \\n\\nIf  the  new  mortgage  actually  obtained  is \\nless  than  the  computed  amount  for  a  new \\nmortgage  ($42,010.18),  the  buydown  shall  be \\nprorated accordingly. If the actual mortgage \\nobtained  in  our  example  were  $35,000,  the \\nbuydown  payment  would  be  $7,706.57  ($35,000 \\ndivided  by  $42,010.18  =  .8331;  $9,250.13  multi-\\nplied by .83 = $7,706.57). \\n\\nThe Agency is obligated to inform the dis-\\nplaced  person  of  the  approximate  amount  of \\nthis  payment  and  that  the  displaced  person \\nmust obtain a mortgage of at least the same \\namount as the old mortgage and for at least \\nthe  same  term  in  order  to  receive  the  full \\namount  of  this  payment.  The  Agency  must \\nadvise  the  displaced  person  of  the  interest \\nrate  and  points  used  to  calculate  the  pay-\\nment. \\n\\nSection  24.402 Replacement  Housing  Pay-\\n\\nment for 90-day Occupants \\n\\nSection  24.402(b)(2)  Low  income  calculation \\nexample.  The  Uniform  Act  requires  that  an \\neligible displaced person who rents a replace-\\nment  dwelling  is  entitled  to  a  rental  assist-\\nance payment calculated in accordance with \\n§ 24.402(b). One factor in this calculation is to \\ndetermine  if  a  displaced  person  is  ‘‘low  in-\\ncome,’’ as defined by the U.S. Department of \\nHousing  and  Urban  Development’s  annual \\nsurvey of income limits for the Public Hous-\\ning and Section 8 Programs. To make such a \\ndetermination,  the  Agency  must:  (1)  Deter-\\nmine  the  total  number  of  members  in  the \\nhousehold  (including  all  adults  and  chil-\\ndren); (2) locate the appropriate table for in-\\ncome  limits  applicable  to  the  Uniform  Act \\nfor the state in which the displaced residence \\nis  located  (found  at:  http://www.fhwa.dot.gov/ \\nrealestate/ua/ualic.htm);  (3)  from  the  list  of \\nlocal jurisdictions shown, identify the appro-\\npriate county, Metropolitan Statistical Area \\n(MSA)*, or Primary Metropolitan Statistical \\nArea  (PMSA)*  in  which  the  displacement \\nproperty is located; and (4) locate the appro-\\npriate  income  limit  in  that  jurisdiction  for \\nthe  size  of  this  displaced  person/family.  The \\nincome  limit  must  then  be  compared  to  the \\nhousehold  income  (§ 24.2(a)(15))  which  is  the \\ngross  annual  income  received  by  the  dis-\\nplaced  family,  excluding  income  from  any \\ndependent  children  and  full-time  students \\nunder the age of 18. If the household income \\nfor  the  eligible  displaced  person/family  is \\nless  than  or  equal  to  the  income  limit,  the \\nfamily  is  considered  ‘‘low  income.’’  For  ex-\\nample: \\n\\nTom and Mary Smith and their three chil-\\ndren  are  being  displaced.

It does, however, provide the latitude \\nfor  Agency  discretion  in  offering  downpay-\\nment  assistance  that  exceeds  the  computed \\nrental  assistance  payment,  up  to  the  $5,250 \\nstatutory  maximum.  This  does  not  mean, \\nhowever,  that  such  Agency  discretion  may \\nbe exercised in a selective or discriminatory \\nfashion.  The  displacing  Agency  should  de-\\nvelop  a  policy  that  affords  equal  treatment \\nfor  displaced  persons  in  like  circumstances \\nand  this  policy  should  be  applied  uniformly \\nthe  Agency’s  programs  or \\nthroughout \\nprojects. \\n\\nFor the purpose of this section, should the \\namount of the rental assistance payment ex-\\nceed  the  purchase  price  of  the  replacement \\ndwelling,  the  payment  would  be  limited  to \\nthe cost of the dwelling. \\n\\nSection  24.404  Replacement  Housing  of  Last \\n\\nResort. \\n\\nSection  24.404(b)  Basic  rights  of  persons  to  be \\ndisplaced. This paragraph affirms the right of \\na  180-day  homeowner-occupant,  who  is  eligi-\\nble for a replacement housing payment under \\n§ 24.401,  to  a  reasonable  opportunity  to  pur-\\nchase  a  comparable  replacement  dwelling. \\nHowever,  it  should  be  read  in  conjunction \\nwith  the  definition  of  ‘‘owner  of  a  dwelling’’ \\nat § 24.2(a)(20). The Agency is not required to \\nprovide  persons  owning  only  a  fractional  in-\\nterest in the displacement dwelling a greater \\nlevel of assistance to purchase a replacement \\ndwelling  than  the  Agency  would  be  required \\nto  provide  such  persons  if  they  owned  fee \\nsimple  title  to  the  displacement  dwelling.  If \\nsuch assistance is not sufficient to buy a re-\\nplacement dwelling, the Agency may provide \\nadditional  purchase  assistance  or  rental  as-\\nsistance. \\n\\nSection  24.404(c)  Methods  of  providing  com-\\nparable replacement housing. This Section em-\\nphasizes  the  use  of  cost  effective  means  of \\nproviding  comparable  replacement  housing. \\nThe  term  ‘‘reasonable  cost’’  is  used  to  high-\\nlight the fact that while innovative means to \\nprovide housing are encouraged, they should \\nbe  cost-effective.  Section  24.404(c)(2)  permits \\nthe  use  of  last  resort  housing,  in  special \\ncases, which may involve variations from the \\nusual  methods  of  obtaining  comparability. \\nHowever,  such  variation  should  never  result \\nin  a  lowering  of  housing  standards  nor \\nshould it ever result in a lower quality of liv-\\ning style for the displaced person. The phys-\\nical  characteristics  of  the  comparable  re-\\nplacement  dwelling  may  be  dissimilar  to \\nthose  of  the  displacement  dwelling  but  they \\nmay never be inferior. \\n\\nOne example might be the use of a new mo-\\nbile home to replace a very substandard con-\\nventional  dwelling  in  an  area  where  com-\\nparable conventional dwellings are not avail-\\nable. \\n\\nAnother  example  could  be  the  use  of  a  su-\\nperior, but smaller, decent, safe and sanitary \\ndwelling  to  replace  a  large,  old  substandard \\ndwelling,  only  a  portion  of  which  is  being \\nused as living quarters by the occupants and \\nno  other  large  comparable  dwellings  are \\navailable in the area. \\n\\n[70 FR 611, Jan. 4, 2005, as amended at 70 FR \\n22611, May 2, 2005] \\n\\nAPPENDIX B TO PART 24—STATISTICAL \\nREPORT FORM \\n\\nThis Appendix sets forth the statistical in-\\nformation collected from Agencies in accord-\\nance with § 24.9(c). \\n\\nGeneral \\n1.

However,  if \\nyou  have  an  existing  DBE  program,  it \\nmust  remain  in  effect  and  you  must \\nseek  to  fulfill  the  objectives  outlined \\nin § 26.1. \\n\\n(b)  Your  overall  goal  must  be  based \\non  demonstrable  evidence  of  the  avail-\\nability of ready, willing and able DBEs \\nrelative to all businesses ready, willing \\nand  able  to  participate  on  your  DOT- \\nassisted contracts (hereafter, the ‘‘rel-\\native  availability  of  DBEs’’).  The  goal \\nmust reflect your determination of the \\nlevel  of  DBE  participation  you  would \\nexpect absent the effects of discrimina-\\ntion. You cannot simply rely on either \\nthe  10  percent  national  goal,  your  pre-\\nvious overall goal or past DBE partici-\\npation  rates  in  your  program  without \\nreference to the relative availability of \\nDBEs in your market. \\n\\n(c)  Step  1.  You  must  begin  your  goal \\nsetting  process  by  determining  a  base \\nfigure  for  the  relative  availability  of \\nDBEs.  The  following  are  examples  of \\napproaches  that  you  may  take  toward \\ndetermining a base figure. These exam-\\nples are provided as a starting point for \\nyour goal setting process. Any percent-\\nage figure derived from one of these ex-\\namples  should  be  considered  a  basis \\nfrom  which  you  begin  when  examining \\nall  evidence  available  in  your  jurisdic-\\ntion.  These  examples  are  not  intended \\nas an exhaustive list. Other methods or \\ncombinations  of  methods  to  determine \\na  base  figure  may  be  used,  subject  to \\napproval  by  the  concerned  operating \\nadministration. \\n\\n(1) Use DBE Directories and Census Bu-\\nreau  Data.  Determine  the  number  of \\nready,  willing  and  able  DBEs  in  your \\nmarket  from  your  DBE  directory. \\nUsing  the  Census  Bureau’s  County \\nBusiness  Pattern  (CBP)  data  base,  de-\\ntermine  the  number  of  all  ready,  will-\\n\\ning  and  able  businesses  available  in \\nyour  market  that  perform  work  in  the \\nsame NAICS codes. (Information about \\nthe  CBP  data  base  may  be  obtained \\nfrom  the  Census  Bureau  at  their  web \\nsite, \\nwww.census.gov/epcd/cbp/view/ \\ncbpview.html.)  Divide  the  number  of \\nDBEs  by  the  number  of  all  businesses \\nto  derive  a  base  figure  for  the  relative \\navailability of DBEs in your market. \\n\\n(2)  Use  a  bidders  list.  Determine  the \\nnumber  of  DBEs  that  have  bid  or \\nquoted (successful and unsuccessful) on \\nyour  DOT-assisted  prime  contracts  or \\nsubcontracts  in  the  past  three  years. \\nDetermine the number of all businesses \\nthat have bid or quoted (successful and \\nunsuccessful) on prime or subcontracts \\nin  the  same  time  period.  Divide  the \\nnumber  of  DBE  bidders  and  quoters  by \\nthe number of all businesses to derive a \\nbase figure for the relative availability \\nof  DBEs  in  your  market.  When  using \\nthis  approach,  you  must  establish  a \\nmechanism  (documented  in  your  goal \\nsubmission) to directly capture data on \\nDBE  and  non-DBE  prime  and  sub-\\ncontractors  that  submitted  bids  or \\nquotes on your DOT-assisted contracts. \\n(3) Use data from a disparity study. Use \\na  percentage  figure  derived  from  data \\nin a valid, applicable disparity study. \\n\\n(4) Use the goal of another DOT recipi-\\nent.  If  another  DOT  recipient  in  the \\nsame,  or  substantially  similar,  market \\nhas  set  an  overall  goal  in  compliance \\nwith  this  rule,  you  may  use  that  goal \\nas a base figure for your goal. \\n\\n(5) Alternative methods. Except as oth-\\nerwise  provided  in  this  paragraph,  you \\nmay use other methods to determine a \\nbase  figure  for  your  overall  goal.  Any \\nmethodology you choose must be based \\non demonstrable evidence of local mar-\\nket conditions and be designed to ulti-\\nmately attain a goal that is rationally \\nrelated  to  the  relative  availability  of \\nDBEs  in  your  market.

You  estimate \\nthat you can obtain 12 percent or more DBE \\nparticipation through the use of race-neutral \\nmeasures, without any use of contract goals. \\nIn  this  case,  you  do  not  set  any  contract \\ngoals  for  the  contracts  that  will  be  per-\\nformed  in  Year  1.  However,  if  part  way \\nthrough Year 1, your DBE awards or commit-\\nments  are  not  at  a  level  that  would  permit \\nyou  to  achieve  your  overall  goal  for  Year  1, \\nyou  could  begin  setting  race-conscious  DBE \\ncontract  goals  during  the  remainder  of  the \\nyear as part of your obligation to implement \\nyour program in good faith. \\n\\n(2)  If,  during  the  course  of  any  year \\nin  which  you  are  using  contract  goals, \\nyou  determine  that  you  will  exceed \\nyour  overall  goal,  you  must  reduce  or \\neliminate  the  use  of  contract  goals  to \\nthe extent necessary to ensure that the \\nuse of contract goals does not result in \\nexceeding  the  overall  goal.  If  you  de-\\ntermine that you will fall short of your \\noverall  goal,  then  you  must  make  ap-\\npropriate  modifications  in  your  use  of \\nrace-neutral \\nrace-conscious \\nmeasures  to  allow  you  to  meet  the \\noverall goal. \\n\\nand/or \\n\\nExample to paragraph (f)(2): In Year II, your \\noverall  goal  is  12  percent.  You  have  esti-\\nmated  that  you  can  obtain  5  percent  DBE \\nparticipation  through  use  of  race-neutral \\nmeasures.  You  therefore  plan  to  obtain  the \\nremaining  7  percent  participation  through \\nuse  of  DBE  goals.  By  September,  you  have \\nalready  obtained  11  percent  DBE  participa-\\ntion  for  the  year.  For  contracts  let  during \\nthe  remainder  of  the  year,  you  use  contract \\ngoals only to the extent necessary to obtain \\nan additional one percent DBE participation. \\nHowever, if you determine in September that \\nyour participation for the year is likely to be \\nonly 8 percent total, then you would increase \\nyour  use  of  race-neutral  and/or  race-con-\\n\\nscious  means  during  the  remainder  of  the \\nyear in order to achieve your overall goal. \\n\\n(3) If the DBE participation you have \\nobtained  by  race-neutral  means  alone \\nmeets or exceeds your overall goals for \\ntwo  consecutive  years,  you  are  not  re-\\nquired  to  make  a  projection  of  the \\namount  of  your  goal  you  can  meet \\nusing such means in the next year. You \\ndo  not  set  contract  goals  on  any  con-\\ntracts  in  the  next  year.  You  continue \\nusing only race-neutral means to meet \\nyour overall goals unless and until you \\ndo  not  meet  your  overall  goal  for  a \\nyear. \\n\\nExample  to  paragraph  (f)(3):  Your  overall \\ngoal for Years I and Year II is 10 percent. The \\nDBE  participation  you  obtain  through  race- \\nneutral measures alone is 10 percent or more \\nin  each  year.  (For  this  purpose,  it  does  not \\nmatter whether you obtained additional DBE \\nparticipation  through  using  contract  goals \\nin  these  years.)  In  Year  III  and  following \\nyears, you do not need to make a projection \\nunder  paragraph  (c)  of  this  section  of  the \\nportion  of  your  overall  goal  you  expect  to \\nmeet  using  race-neutral  means.  You  simply \\nuse race-neutral means to achieve your over-\\nall  goals.  However,  if  in  Year  VI  your  DBE \\nparticipation falls short of your overall goal, \\nthen  you  must  make  a  paragraph  (c)  projec-\\ntion  for  Year  VII  and,  if  necessary,  resume \\nuse of contract goals in that year. \\n\\n(4)  If  you  obtain  DBE  participation \\nthat  exceeds  your  overall  goal  in  two \\nconsecutive  years  through  the  use  of \\ncontract goals (i.e., not through the use \\nof race-neutral means alone), you must \\nreduce  your  use  of  contract  goals  pro-\\nportionately in the following year. \\n\\nExample  to  paragraph  (f)(4):  In  Years  I  and \\nII,  your  overall  goal  is  12  percent,  and  you \\nobtain  14  and  16  percent  DBE  participation, \\nrespectively.  You  have  exceeded  your  goals \\nover the two-year period by an average of 25 \\npercent.  In  Year  III,  your  overall  goal  is \\nagain 12 percent, and your paragraph (c) pro-\\njection estimates that you will obtain 4 per-\\ncent DBE participation through race-neutral \\nmeans and 8 percent through contract goals. \\nYou then reduce the contract goal projection \\nby  25  percent  (i.e.,  from  8  to  6  percent)  and \\nset  contract  goals  accordingly  during  the \\nyear. If in Year III you obtain 11 percent par-\\nticipation, you do not use this contract goal \\nadjustment  mechanism  for  Year  IV,  because \\nthere  have  not  been  two  consecutive  years  of \\nexceeding overall goals. \\n\\n(g)  In  any  year  in  which  you  project \\nmeeting  part  of  your  goal  through \\nrace-neutral  means  and  the  remainder \\n\\n261 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00271 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0c§ 26.53 \\n\\n49 CFR Subtitle A (10–1–21 Edition) \\n\\nthrough  contract  goals,  you  must \\nmaintain  data  separately  on  DBE \\nachievements  in  those  contracts  with \\nand  without  contract  goals,  respec-\\ntively.

Work  that  a  DBE  sub-\\ncontracts  to  a  non-DBE  firm  does  not \\ncount toward DBE goals. \\n\\n(b) When a DBE performs as a partic-\\nipant  in  a  joint  venture,  count  a  por-\\ntion  of  the  total  dollar  value  of  the \\ncontract  equal  to  the  distinct,  clearly \\ndefined portion of the work of the con-\\ntract  that  the  DBE  performs  with  its \\nown forces toward DBE goals. \\n\\n(c) Count expenditures to a DBE con-\\ntractor  toward  DBE  goals  only  if  the \\nDBE is performing a commercially use-\\nful function on that contract. \\n\\n(1)  A  DBE  performs  a  commercially \\nuseful  function  when  it  is  responsible \\nfor  execution  of  the  work  of  the  con-\\ntract  and  is  carrying  out  its  respon-\\nsibilities  by  actually  performing,  man-\\naging,  and  supervising  the  work  in-\\nvolved.  To  perform  a  commercially \\nuseful  function,  the  DBE  must  also  be \\nresponsible,  with  respect  to  materials \\nand  supplies  used  on  the  contract,  for \\nnegotiating  price,  determining  quality \\nand  quantity,  ordering  the  material, \\nand  installing  (where  applicable)  and \\npaying  for  the  material  itself.  To  de-\\ntermine whether a DBE is performing a \\ncommercially  useful \\nfunction,  you \\nmust evaluate the amount of work sub-\\ncontracted, industry practices, whether \\nthe amount the firm is to be paid under \\nthe contract is commensurate with the \\nwork  it  is  actually  performing  and  the \\nDBE credit claimed for its performance \\nof the work, and other relevant factors. \\n(2)  A  DBE  does  not  perform  a  com-\\nmercially  useful  function  if  its  role  is \\nlimited  to  that  of  an  extra  participant \\nin  a  transaction,  contract,  or  project \\nthrough  which  funds  are  passed  in \\norder  to  obtain  the  appearance  of  DBE \\nparticipation.  In  determining  whether \\na DBE is such an extra participant, you \\n\\nmust  examine  similar  transactions, \\nparticularly  those  in  which  DBEs  do \\nnot participate. \\n\\n(3) If a DBE does not perform or exer-\\ncise  responsibility  for  at  least  30  per-\\ncent  of  the  total  cost  of  its  contract \\nwith  its  own  work  force,  or  the  DBE \\nsubcontracts  a  greater  portion  of  the \\nwork  of  a  contract  than  would  be  ex-\\npected  on  the  basis  of  normal  industry \\npractice for the  type of work involved, \\nyou  must  presume  that  it  is  not  per-\\nforming  a  commercially  useful  func-\\ntion. \\n\\n(4) When a DBE is presumed not to be \\nperforming a commercially useful func-\\ntion  as  provided  in  paragraph  (c)(3)  of \\nthis section, the DBE may present evi-\\ndence  to  rebut  this  presumption.  You \\nmay  determine  that  the  firm  is  per-\\nforming  a  commercially  useful  func-\\ntion  given  the  type  of  work  involved \\nand normal industry practices. \\n\\n(5)  Your  decisions  on  commercially \\nuseful  function  matters  are  subject  to \\nreview  by  the  concerned  operating  ad-\\nministration,  but  are  not  administra-\\ntively appealable to DOT. \\n\\n(d) Use the following factors in deter-\\nmining  whether  a  DBE  trucking  com-\\npany  is  performing  a  commercially \\nuseful function: \\n\\n(1)  The  DBE  must  be  responsible  for \\nthe management and supervision of the \\nentire  trucking  operation  for  which  it \\nis responsible on a particular contract, \\nand  there  cannot  be  a  contrived  ar-\\nrangement  for  the  purpose  of  meeting \\nDBE goals. \\n\\n(2)  The  DBE  must  itself  own  and  op-\\nerate  at  least  one  fully  licensed,  in-\\nsured,  and  operational  truck  used  on \\nthe contract. \\n\\n(3)  The  DBE  receives  credit  for  the \\ntotal  value  of  the  transportation  serv-\\nices  it  provides  on  the  contract  using \\ntrucks  it  owns,  insures,  and  operates \\nusing drivers it employs. \\n\\n(4)  The  DBE  may  lease  trucks  from \\nanother DBE firm, including an owner- \\noperator who is certified as a DBE.

Exclusions \\nfor  net  worth  purposes  are  not  exclu-\\nsions  for  asset  valuation  or  access  to \\ncapital and credit purposes. \\n\\n(C)  Do  not  use  a  contingent  liability \\n\\nto reduce an individual’s net worth. \\n\\n(D)  With  respect  to  assets  held  in \\nvested pension plans, Individual Retire-\\nment  Accounts,  401(k)  accounts,  or \\nother retirement savings or investment \\nprograms in which the assets cannot be \\ndistributed  to  the  individual  at  the \\npresent  time  without  significant  ad-\\nverse  tax  or  interest  consequences,  in-\\nclude only the present value of such as-\\nsets, less the tax and interest penalties \\nthat would accrue if the asset were dis-\\ntributed at the present time. \\n\\n(iv) Notwithstanding any provision of \\nFederal or State law, you must not re-\\nlease  an \\nindividual’s  personal  net \\nworth  statement  nor  any  documents \\npertaining  to  it  to  any  third  party \\nwithout the written consent of the sub-\\nmitter.

(1) An individual’s presump-\\ntion  of  economic  disadvantage  may  be \\nrebutted in two ways. \\n\\n(i)  If  the  statement  of  personal  net \\nworth  and  supporting  documentation \\nthat an individual submits under para-\\ngraph  (a)(2)  of  this  section  shows  that \\nthe individual’s personal net worth ex-\\nceeds  $1.32  million,  the  individual’s \\npresumption  of  economic  disadvantage \\nis  rebutted.  You  are  not  required  to \\nhave  a  proceeding  under  paragraph \\n(b)(2)  of  this  section  in  order  to  rebut \\nthe presumption of economic disadvan-\\ntage in this case. \\n\\nExample to paragraph (b)(1)(i): An individual \\nwith  very  high  assets  and  significant  liabil-\\nities may, in accounting terms, have a PNW \\nof  less  than  $1.32  million.  However,  the  per-\\nson’s  assets  collectively  (e.g.,  high  income \\nlevel, a very expensive house, a yacht, exten-\\nsive real or personal property holdings) may \\nlead a reasonable person to conclude that he \\nor  she  is  not  economically  disadvantaged. \\n\\nThe recipient may rebut the individual’s pre-\\nsumption  of  economic  disadvantage  under \\nthese circumstances, as provided in this sec-\\ntion,  even  though  the  individual’s  PNW  is \\nless than $1.32 million. \\n\\n(ii)(A)  If  the  statement  of  personal \\nnet  worth  and  supporting  documenta-\\ntion  that  an  individual  submits  under \\nparagraph  (a)(2)  of  this  section  dem-\\nonstrates that the individual is able to \\naccumulate  substantial  wealth,  the  in-\\ndividual’s  presumption  of  economic \\ndisadvantage  is  rebutted.  In  making \\nthis  determination,  as  a  certifying \\nagency,  you  may  consider  factors  that \\ninclude, but are not limited to, the fol-\\nlowing: \\n\\n(1)  Whether  the  average  adjusted \\ngross  income  of  the  owner  over  the \\nmost  recent  three  year  period  exceeds \\n$350,000; \\n\\n(2)  Whether  the  income  was  unusual \\n\\nand not likely to occur in the future; \\n\\n(3)  Whether  the  earnings  were  offset \\n\\nby losses; \\n\\n(4)  Whether  the  income  was  rein-\\nvested in the firm or used to pay taxes \\narising  in  the  normal  course  of  oper-\\nations by the firm; \\n\\n(5) Other evidence that income is not \\nindicative  of  lack  of  economic  dis-\\nadvantage; and \\n\\n(6)  Whether  the  total  fair  market \\nvalue  of  the  owner’s  assets  exceed  $6 \\nmillion. \\n\\n(B)  You  must  have  a  proceeding \\nunder paragraph (b)(2) of this section in \\norder  to  rebut  the  presumption  of  eco-\\nnomic disadvantage in this case. \\n\\n(2)  If  you  have  a  reasonable  basis  to \\nbelieve  that  an  individual  who  is  a \\nmember of one of the designated groups \\nis not, in fact, socially and/or economi-\\ncally  disadvantaged  you  may,  at  any \\ntime,  start  a  proceeding  to  determine \\nwhether  the  presumption  should  be  re-\\ngarded as rebutted with respect to that \\nindividual.  Your  proceeding  must  fol-\\nlow the procedures of § 26.87. \\n\\n(3) In such a proceeding, you have the \\nburden  of  demonstrating,  by  a  prepon-\\nderance  of  the  evidence,  that  the  indi-\\nvidual is not socially and economically \\ndisadvantaged. You may require the in-\\ndividual  to  produce  information  rel-\\nevant  to  the  determination  of  his  or \\nher disadvantage. \\n\\n(4) When an individual’s presumption \\nof social and/or economic disadvantage \\n\\n269 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00279 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0c§ 26.69 \\n\\n49 CFR Subtitle A (10–1–21 Edition) \\n\\nhas been rebutted, his or her ownership \\nand control of the firm in question can-\\nnot  be  used  for  purposes  of  DBE  eligi-\\nbility  under  this  subpart  unless  and \\nuntil  he  or  she  makes  an  individual \\nshowing  of  social  and/or  economic  dis-\\nadvantage.

You  must \\nmake  a  case-by-case  determination  of \\nwhether  each  individual  whose  owner-\\nship  and  control  are  relied  upon  for \\nDBE  certification  is  socially  and  eco-\\nnomically  disadvantaged.

The  individual’s  con-\\ntribution  to  capital  would  not  be  viewed  as \\nsubstantial. \\n\\n(ii) A 51% disadvantaged owner and a non- \\ndisadvantaged 49% owner contribute $100 and \\n$10,000,  respectively,  to  acquire  a  firm \\ngrossing  $1  million.  This  may  be  indicative \\nof  a  pro  forma  arrangement  that  does  not \\nmeet the requirements of (c)(1). \\n\\n(iii) The disadvantaged owner of a DBE ap-\\nplicant firm spends $250 to file articles of in-\\ncorporation  and  obtains  a  $100,000  loan,  but \\nmakes only nominal or sporadic payments to \\nrepay  the  loan.

Generally, \\nexpertise  limited  to  office  manage-\\nment,  administration,  or  bookkeeping \\nfunctions  unrelated  to  the  principal \\nbusiness activities of the firm is insuf-\\nficient to demonstrate control. \\n\\n(h)  If  state  or  local  law  requires  the \\npersons  to  have  a  particular  license  or \\nother credential in order to own and/or \\ncontrol a certain type of firm, then the \\nsocially  and  economically  disadvan-\\ntaged  persons  who  own  and  control  a \\npotential  DBE  firm  of  that  type  must \\npossess  the  required  license  or  creden-\\ntial.  If  state  or  local  law  does  not  re-\\nquire  such  a  person  to  have  such  a  li-\\ncense  or  credential  to  own  and/or  con-\\ntrol  a  firm,  you  must  not  deny  certifi-\\ncation  solely  on  the  ground  that  the \\nperson  lacks  the  license  or  credential. \\nHowever,  you  may  take  into  account \\nthe absence of the license or credential \\nas  one  factor  in  determining  whether \\nthe  socially  and  economically  dis-\\nadvantaged  owners  actually  control \\nthe firm. \\n\\n(i)(1) You may consider differences in \\nremuneration between the socially and \\neconomically  disadvantaged  owners \\nand  other  participants  in  the  firm  in \\ndetermining  whether  to  certify  a  firm \\nas  a  DBE.  Such  consideration  shall  be \\nin the context of the duties of the per-\\nsons  involved,  normal  industry  prac-\\ntices,  the  firm’s  policy  and  practice \\nconcerning  reinvestment  of  income, \\nand any other explanations for the dif-\\nferences  proffered  by  the  firm.  You \\nmay  determine  that  a  firm  is  con-\\ntrolled  by  its  socially  and  economi-\\ncally  disadvantaged  owner  although \\nthat  owner’s  remuneration  is  lower \\nthan that of some other participants in \\nthe firm. \\n\\n(2)  In  a  case  where  a  non-disadvan-\\ntaged  individual  formerly  controlled \\nthe  firm,  and  a  socially  and  economi-\\ncally  disadvantaged  individual  now \\ncontrols  it,  you  may  consider  a  dif-\\nference  between  the  remuneration  of \\nthe  former  and  current  controller  of \\n\\nthe firm as a factor in determining who \\ncontrols  the  firm,  particularly  when \\nthe  non-disadvantaged  individual  re-\\nmains  involved  with  the  firm  and  con-\\ntinues to receive greater compensation \\nthan the disadvantaged individual. \\n\\n(j)  In  order  to  be  viewed  as  control-\\nling  a  firm,  a  socially  and  economi-\\ncally  disadvantaged  owner  cannot  en-\\ngage  in  outside  employment  or  other \\nbusiness  interests  that  conflict  with \\nthe management of the firm or prevent \\nthe  individual  from  devoting  sufficient \\ntime and attention to the affairs of the \\nfirm  to  control  its  activities.  For  ex-\\nample,  absentee  ownership  of  a  busi-\\nness  and  part-time  work  in  a  full-time \\nfirm  are  not  viewed  as  constituting \\ncontrol.  However,  an  individual  could \\nbe  viewed  as  controlling  a  part-time \\nbusiness  that  operates  only  on  eve-\\nnings  and/or  weekends,  if  the  indi-\\nvidual controls it all the time it is op-\\nerating. \\n\\n(k)(1)  A  socially  and  economically \\ndisadvantaged  individual  may  control \\na  firm  even  though  one  or  more  of  the \\nindividual’s  immediate  family  mem-\\nbers  (who  themselves  are  not  socially \\nand  economically  disadvantaged  indi-\\nviduals)  participate  in  the  firm  as  a \\nmanager,  employee,  owner,  or  in  an-\\nother  capacity.

To  become  cer-\\ntified  in  an  additional  type  of  work, \\nthe firm need demonstrate to you only \\nthat  its  socially  and  economically  dis-\\nadvantaged  owners  are  able  to  control \\nthe  firm  with  respect  to  that  type  of \\nwork.  You  must  not  require  that  the \\nfirm be recertified or submit a new ap-\\nplication  for  certification,  but  you \\nmust  verify  the  disadvantaged  owner’s \\ncontrol  of  the  firm  in  the  additional \\ntype of work. \\n\\n(1) The types of work a firm can per-\\nform  (whether  on  initial  certification \\nor  when  a  new  type  of  work  is  added) \\nmust be described in terms of the most \\nspecific  available  NAICS  code  for  that \\ntype  of  work.  If  you  choose,  you  may \\nalso, in addition to applying the appro-\\npriate  NAICS  code,  apply  a  descriptor \\nfrom a classification scheme of equiva-\\nlent  detail  and  specificity.  A  correct \\nNAICS  code  is  one  that  describes,  as \\n\\nspecifically  as  possible,  the  principal \\ngoods or services which the firm would \\nprovide  to  DOT  recipients.  Multiple \\nNAICS  codes  may  be  assigned  where \\nappropriate.  Program \\nparticipants \\nmust rely on, and not depart from, the \\nplain  meaning  of  NAICS  code  descrip-\\ntions  in  determining  the  scope  of  a \\nfirm’s  certification.  If  your  Directory \\ndoes not list types of work for any firm \\nin  a  manner  consistent  with  this  para-\\ngraph  (a)(1),  you  must  update  the  Di-\\nrectory entry for that firm to meet the \\nrequirements  of  this  paragraph  (a)(1) \\nby August 28, 2011. \\n\\n(2)  Firms  and  recipients  must  check \\ncarefully to make sure that the NAICS \\ncodes  cited  in  a  certification  are  kept \\nup-to-date  and  accurately  reflect  work \\nwhich  the  UCP  has  determined  the \\nfirm’s  owners  can  control.  The  firm \\nbears  the  burden  of  providing  detailed \\ncompany  information  the  certifying \\nagency  needs  to  make  an  appropriate \\nNAICS code designation. \\n\\n(3) If a firm believes that there is not \\na  NAICS  code  that  fully  or  clearly  de-\\nscribes  the  type(s)  of  work  in  which  it \\nis seeking to be certified as a DBE, the \\nfirm  may  request  that  the  certifying \\nagency, in its certification documenta-\\ntion,  supplement  the  assigned  NAICS \\ncode(s)  with  a  clear,  specific,  and  de-\\ntailed narrative description of the type \\nof  work  in  which  the  firm  is  certified. \\nA vague, general, or  confusing descrip-\\ntion  is  not  sufficient  for  this  purpose, \\nand  recipients  should  not  rely  on  such \\na description in determining whether a \\nfirm’s participation can be counted to-\\nward DBE goals. \\n\\n(4)  A  certifier  is  not  precluded  from \\nchanging  a  certification  classification \\nor description if there is a factual basis \\nin the record.

You  must  not  refuse  to \\ncertify a firm based solely on historical \\ninformation indicating a lack of owner-\\nship  or  control  of  the  firm  by  socially \\nand  economically  disadvantaged  indi-\\nviduals at some time in the past, if the \\nfirm  currently  meets  the  ownership \\nand control standards of this part. \\n\\n(2)  You  must  not  refuse  to  certify  a \\nfirm  solely  on  the  basis  that  it  is  a \\nnewly  formed  firm,  has  not  completed \\nprojects or contracts at the time of its \\napplication, has not yet realized profits \\nfrom  its  activities,  or  has  not  dem-\\nonstrated a potential for success. If the \\nfirm  meets  disadvantaged,  size,  owner-\\nship,  and  control  requirements  of  this \\nPart,  the  firm  is  eligible  for  certifi-\\ncation. \\n\\n(c) DBE firms and firms seeking DBE \\ncertification shall cooperate fully with \\nyour  requests  (and  DOT  requests)  for \\ninformation  relevant  to  the  certifi-\\ncation  process.  Failure  or  refusal  to \\nprovide  such  information  is  a  ground \\nfor a denial or removal of certification. \\n(d)  Only  firms  organized  for  profit \\nmay  be  eligible  DBEs.  Not-for-profit \\norganizations,  even  though  controlled \\nby socially and economically disadvan-\\ntaged individuals, are not eligible to be \\ncertified as DBEs. \\n\\n(e)  An  eligible  DBE  firm  must  be \\nowned  by  individuals  who  are  socially \\nand  economically  disadvantaged.

The  following  examples  illus-\\ntrate  how  this  cumulative  ownership \\nprovision works: \\n\\nExample  1:  Socially  and  economically  dis-\\nadvantaged  individuals  own  100  percent  of  a \\nholding  company,  which  has  a  wholly-owned \\nsubsidiary.  The  subsidiary  may  be  certified, \\nif it meets all other requirements. \\n\\nExample  2:  Disadvantaged  individuals  own \\n100  percent  of  the  holding  company,  which \\nowns  51  percent  of  a  subsidiary.  The  sub-\\nsidiary may be certified, if all other require-\\nments are met. \\n\\nExample  3:  Disadvantaged  individuals  own \\n80  percent  of  the  holding  company,  which  in \\nturn  owns  70  percent  of  a  subsidiary.  In  this \\ncase,  the  cumulative  ownership  of  the  sub-\\nsidiary  by  disadvantaged  individuals  is  56 \\npercent (80 percent of the 70 percent). This is \\nmore than 51 percent, so you may certify the \\nsubsidiary, if all other requirements are met. \\nExample  4:  Same  as  Example  2  or  3,  but \\nsomeone  other  than  the  socially  and  eco-\\nnomically  disadvantaged  owners  of  the  par-\\nent  or  holding  company  controls  the  sub-\\nsidiary. Even though the subsidiary is owned \\nby  disadvantaged  individuals,  through  the \\nholding  or  parent  company,  you  cannot  cer-\\ntify  it  because  it  fails  to  meet  control  re-\\nquirements. \\n\\nExample  5:  Disadvantaged  individuals  own \\n60  percent  of  the  holding  company,  which  in \\nturn  owns  51  percent  of  a  subsidiary.  In  this \\ncase,  the  cumulative  ownership  of  the  sub-\\nsidiary by disadvantaged individuals is about \\n31  percent.  This  is  less  than  51  percent,  so \\nyou cannot certify the subsidiary. \\n\\nExample  6:  The  holding  company,  in  addi-\\ntion  to  the  subsidiary  seeking  certification, \\nowns several other companies. The combined \\ngross  receipts  of  the  holding  companies  and \\nits  subsidiaries  are  greater  than  the  size \\nstandard  for  the  subsidiary  seeking  certifi-\\ncation  and/or  the  gross  receipts  cap  of \\n§ 26.65(b).

When,  as  a  recipient,  you  establish  a \\ncontract goal on a DOT-assisted contract for \\nprocuring  construction,  equipment,  services, \\nor any other purpose, a bidder must, in order \\nto  be  responsible  and/or  responsive,  make \\nsufficient good faith efforts to meet the goal. \\nThe  bidder  can  meet  this  requirement  in  ei-\\nther of two ways. First, the bidder can meet \\nthe goal, documenting commitments for par-\\nticipation  by  DBE  firms  sufficient  for  this \\npurpose.  Second,  even  if  it  doesn’t  meet  the \\ngoal, the bidder can document adequate good \\nfaith  efforts.  This  means  that  the  bidder \\nmust  show  that  it  took  all  necessary  and \\nreasonable  steps  to  achieve  a  DBE  goal  or \\nother  requirement  of  this  part  which,  by \\ntheir  scope,  intensity,  and  appropriateness \\nto  the  objective,  could  reasonably  be  ex-\\npected  to  obtain  sufficient  DBE  participa-\\ntion, even if they were not fully successful. \\n\\nII.  In  any  situation  in  which  you  have  es-\\ntablished  a  contract  goal,  Part  26  requires \\nyou to use the good faith efforts mechanism \\nof this part. As a recipient, you have the re-\\nsponsibility  to  make  a  fair  and  reasonable \\njudgment whether a bidder that did not meet \\nthe goal made adequate good faith efforts. It \\nis important for you to consider the quality, \\nquantity, and intensity of the different kinds \\nof efforts that the bidder has made, based on \\nthe regulations and the guidance in this Ap-\\npendix. \\n\\nThe  efforts  employed  by  the  bidder  should \\nbe  those  that  one  could  reasonably  expect  a \\nbidder to take if the bidder were actively and \\naggressively trying to obtain DBE participa-\\ntion  sufficient  to  meet  the  DBE  contract \\ngoal.  Mere  pro  forma  efforts  are  not  good \\nfaith  efforts  to  meet  the  DBE  contract  re-\\nquirements.  We  emphasize,  however,  that \\nyour  determination  concerning  the  suffi-\\nciency  of  the  firm’s  good  faith  efforts  is  a \\njudgment call. Determinations should not be \\nmade using quantitative formulas. \\n\\nIII. The Department also strongly cautions \\nyou  against  requiring  that  a  bidder  meet  a \\ncontract goal (i.e., obtain a specified amount \\nof DBE participation) in order to be awarded \\na contract, even though the bidder makes an \\nadequate  good  faith  efforts  showing.  This \\nrule specifically prohibits you from ignoring \\nbona fide good faith efforts. \\n\\nIV.  The  following  is  a  list  of  types  of  ac-\\ntions  which  you  should  consider  as  part  of \\nthe bidder’s good faith efforts to obtain DBE \\n\\n291 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00301 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cPt. 26, App. A \\n\\n49 CFR Subtitle A (10–1–21 Edition) \\n\\nparticipation. It is not intended to be a man-\\ndatory checklist, nor is it intended to be ex-\\nclusive or exhaustive. Other factors or types \\nof  efforts  may  be  relevant  in  appropriate \\ncases. \\n\\nA.  (1)  Conducing  market  research  to  iden-\\ntify small business contractors and suppliers \\nand  soliciting  through  all  reasonable  and \\navailable  means  the  interest  of  all  certified \\nDBEs  that  have  the  capability  to  perform \\nthe  work  of  the  contract.  This  may  include \\nattendance  at  pre-bid  and  business  match-\\nmaking  meetings  and  events,  advertising \\nand/or  written  notices,  posting  of  Notices  of \\nSources  Sought  and/or  Requests  for  Pro-\\nposals, written notices or emails to all DBEs \\nlisted  in  the  State’s  directory  of  transpor-\\ntation  firms  that  specialize  in  the  areas  of \\nwork desired (as noted in the DBE directory) \\nand  which  are  located  in  the  area  or  sur-\\nrounding areas of the project. \\n\\n(2)  The  bidder  should  solicit  this  interest \\nas  early  in  the  acquisition  process  as  prac-\\nticable  to  allow  the  DBEs  to  respond  to  the \\nsolicitation and submit a timely offer for the \\nsubcontract.  The  bidder  should  determine \\nwith certainty if the DBEs are interested by \\ntaking  appropriate  steps  to  follow  up  initial \\nsolicitations. \\n\\nB. Selecting portions of the work to be per-\\nformed  by  DBEs  in  order  to  increase  the \\nlikelihood  that  the  DBE  goals  will  be \\nachieved.  This  includes,  where  appropriate, \\nbreaking  out  contract  work  items  into  eco-\\nnomically feasible units (for example, small-\\ner tasks or quantities) to facilitate DBE par-\\nticipation,  even  when  the  prime  contractor \\nmight  otherwise  prefer  to  perform  these \\nwork items with its own forces. This may in-\\nclude,  where  possible,  establishing  flexible \\ntimeframes  for  performance  and  delivery \\nschedules  in  a  manner  that  encourages  and \\nfacilitates DBE participation. \\n\\nC.  Providing  interested  DBEs  with  ade-\\nquate information about the plans, specifica-\\ntions,  and  requirements  of  the  contract  in  a \\ntimely  manner  to  assist  them  in  responding \\nto a solicitation with their offer for the sub-\\ncontract. \\n\\nD. (1) Negotiating in good faith with inter-\\nested  DBEs.  It  is  the  bidder’s  responsibility \\nto  make  a  portion  of  the  work  available  to \\nDBE subcontractors and suppliers and to se-\\nlect  those  portions  of  the  work  or  material \\nneeds consistent with the available DBE sub-\\ncontractors  and  suppliers,  so  as  to  facilitate \\nDBE participation. Evidence of such negotia-\\ntion includes the names, addresses, and tele-\\nphone  numbers  of  DBEs  that  were  consid-\\nered;  a  description  of  the  information  pro-\\nvided  regarding  the  plans  and  specifications \\nfor the work selected for subcontracting; and \\nevidence  as  to  why  additional  Agreements \\ncould not be reached for DBEs to perform the \\nwork. \\n\\n(2)  A  bidder  using  good  business  judgment \\nwould consider a number of factors in negoti-\\n\\nating  with  subcontractors,  including  DBE \\nsubcontractors,  and  would  take  a  firm’s \\nprice  and  capabilities  as  well  as  contract \\ngoals  into  consideration.  However,  the  fact \\nthat  there  may  be  some  additional  costs  in-\\nvolved  in  finding  and  using  DBEs  is  not  in \\nitself  sufficient  reason  for  a  bidder’s  failure \\nto  meet  the  contract  DBE  goal,  as  long  as \\nsuch  costs  are  reasonable.  Also,  the  ability \\nor  desire  of  a  prime  contractor  to  perform \\nthe work of a contract with its own organiza-\\ntion  does  not  relieve  the  bidder  of  the  re-\\nsponsibility  to  make  good  faith  efforts. \\nPrime contractors are not, however, required \\nto  accept  higher  quotes  from  DBEs  if  the \\nprice difference is excessive or unreasonable. \\nE. (1) Not rejecting DBEs as being unquali-\\nfied  without  sound  reasons  based  on  a  thor-\\nough  investigation  of  their  capabilities.  The \\ncontractor’s  standing  within  its  industry, \\nmembership  in  specific  groups,  organiza-\\ntions,  or  associations  and  political  or  social \\naffiliations (for example union vs. non-union \\nstatus)  are  not  legitimate  causes  for  the  re-\\njection or non-solicitation of bids in the con-\\ntractor’s  efforts  to  meet  the  project  goal. \\nAnother  practice  considered  an  insufficient \\ngood  faith  effort  is  the  rejection  of  the  DBE \\nbecause  its  quotation  for  the  work  was  not \\nthe lowest received. However, nothing in this \\nparagraph  shall  be  construed  to  require  the \\nbidder  or  prime  contractor  to  accept  unrea-\\nsonable  quotes  in  order  to  satisfy  contract \\ngoals. \\n\\n(2) A prime contractor’s inability to find a \\nreplacement DBE at the original price is not \\nalone  sufficient  to  support  a  finding  that \\ngood faith efforts have been made to replace \\nthe  original  DBE.  The  fact  that  the  con-\\ntractor  has  the  ability  and/or  desire  to  per-\\nform  the  contract  work  with  its  own  forces \\ndoes not relieve the contractor of the obliga-\\ntion  to  make  good  faith  efforts  to  find  a  re-\\nplacement  DBE,  and  it  is  not  a  sound  basis \\nfor  rejecting  a  prospective  replacement \\nDBE’s reasonable quote. \\n\\nF. Making efforts to assist interested DBEs \\nin  obtaining  bonding,  lines  of  credit,  or  in-\\nsurance  as  required  by  the  recipient  or  con-\\ntractor. \\n\\nG.  Making  efforts  to  assist  interested \\nDBEs in obtaining necessary equipment, sup-\\nplies,  materials,  or  related  assistance  or \\nservices. \\n\\nH.  Effectively  using  the  services  of  avail-\\nable  minority/women  community  organiza-\\ntions;  minority/women  contractors’  groups; \\nlocal,  State,  and  Federal  minority/women \\nbusiness assistance offices; and other organi-\\nzations as allowed on a case-by-case basis to \\nprovide  assistance  in  the  recruitment  and \\nplacement of DBEs. \\n\\nV.  In  determining  whether  a  bidder  has \\nmade  good  faith  efforts,  it  is  essential  to \\nscrutinize  its  documented  efforts.  At  a  min-\\nimum,  you  must  review  the  performance  of \\nother  bidders  in  meeting  the  contract  goal. \\n\\n292 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00302 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cOffice of the Secretary of Transportation \\n\\nPt. 26, App. B \\n\\nFor  example,  when  the  apparent  successful \\nbidder  fails  to  meet  the  contract  goal,  but \\nothers meet it, you may reasonably raise the \\nquestion  of  whether,  with  additional  efforts, \\nthe  apparent  successful  bidder  could  have \\nmet  the  goal.  If the  apparent  successful bid-\\nder  fails  to  meet  the  goal,  but  meets  or  ex-\\nceeds  the  average  DBE  participation  ob-\\ntained  by  other  bidders,  you  may  view  this, \\nin  conjunction  with  other  factors,  as  evi-\\ndence  of  the  apparent  successful  bidder  hav-\\ning  made  good  faith  efforts.  As  provided  in \\n§ 26.53(b)(2)((vi),  you  must  also  require  the \\ncontractor to submit copies of each DBE and \\nnon-DBE  subcontractor  quote  submitted  to \\nthe  bidder  when  a  non-DBE  subcontractor \\nwas selected over a DBE for work on the con-\\ntract  to  review  whether  DBE  prices  were \\nsubstantially  higher;  and  contact  the  DBEs \\nlisted  on  a  contractor’s  solicitation  to  in-\\nquire  as  to  whether  they  were  contacted  by \\nthe  prime.  Pro  forma  mailings  to  DBEs  re-\\nquesting bids are not alone sufficient to sat-\\nisfy good faith efforts under the rule. \\n\\nVI.  A  promise  to  use  DBEs  after  contract \\naward  is  not  considered  to  be  responsive  to \\nthe  contract  solicitation  or  to  constitute \\ngood faith efforts. \\n\\n[79 FR 59600, Oct. 2, 2014] \\n\\nAPPENDIX B  TO PART 26—UNIFORM RE-\\nPORT OF DBE  AWARDS OR COMMIT-\\nMENTS AND PAYMENTS FORM \\n\\nINSTRUCTIONS  FOR  COMPLETING  THE \\nUNIFORM  REPORT  OF  DBE  AWARDS/ \\nCOMMITMENTS AND PAYMENTS \\n\\nRecipients  of  Department  of  Transpor-\\ntation  (DOT)  funds  are  expected  to  keep  ac-\\ncurate data regarding the contracting oppor-\\ntunities available to firms paid for with DOT \\ndollars.

The term should con-\\nsist of two stages; a developmental stage and \\na transitional stage. \\n\\n(B)  In  order  for  a  firm  to  remain  eligible \\nfor  program  participation,  it  must  continue \\nto  meet  all  eligibility  criteria  contained  in \\npart 26. \\n\\n(C)  By  no  later  than  6  months  of  program \\nentry,  the  participant  should  develop  and \\nsubmit  to  the  recipient  a  comprehensive \\nbusiness  plan  setting  forth  the  participant’s \\nbusiness  targets,  objectives  and  goals.  The \\nparticipant  will  not  be  eligible  for  program \\nbenefits  until  such  business  plan  is  sub-\\nmitted  and  approved  by  the  recipient.  The \\napproved  business  plan  will  constitute  the \\nparticipant’s  short  and  long  term  goals  and \\nthe strategy for developmental growth to the \\npoint  of  economic  viability  in  non-tradi-\\ntional areas of work and/or work outside the \\nDBE program. \\n\\n(D)  The  business  plan  should  contain  at \\n\\nleast the following: \\n\\n(1)  An  analysis  of  market  potential,  com-\\npetitive  environment  and  other  business \\nanalyses  estimating  the  program  partici-\\npant’s prospects for profitable operation dur-\\ning  the  term  of  program  participation  and \\nafter graduation from the program. \\n\\n(2)  An  analysis  of  the  firm’s  strengths  and \\nweaknesses,  with  particular  attention  paid \\nto  the  means  of  correcting  any  financial, \\nmanagerial,  technical,  or  labor  conditions \\nwhich could impede the participant from re-\\nceiving  contracts  other  than  those  in  tradi-\\ntional areas of DBE participation. \\n\\n(3)  Specific  targets,  objectives,  and  goals \\nfor  the  business  development  of  the  partici-\\npant during the next two years, utilizing the \\nresults of the analysis conducted pursuant to \\nparagraphs (C) and (D)(1) of this appendix; \\n\\n(4)  Estimates  of  contract  awards  from  the \\nDBE  program  and  from  other  sources  which \\nare  needed  to  meet  the  objectives  and  goals \\nfor  the  years  covered  by  the  business  plan; \\nand \\n\\n(5) Such other information as the recipient \\n\\nmay require. \\n\\n(E)  Each  participant  should  annually  re-\\nview  its  currently  approved  business  plan \\nwith  the  recipient  and  modify  the  plan  as \\nmay  be  appropriate  to  account  for  any \\nchanges in the firm’s structure and redefined \\nneeds. The currently approved plan should be \\nconsidered  the  applicable  plan  for  all  pro-\\ngram  purposes  until  the  recipient  approves \\nin  writing  a  modified  plan.  The  recipient \\nshould  establish  an  anniversary  date  for  re-\\nview  of  the  participant’s  business  plan  and \\ncontract forecasts. \\n\\n(F)  Each  participant  should  annually  fore-\\ncast  in  writing  its  need  for  contract  awards \\nfor  the  next  program  year  and  the  suc-\\nceeding  program  year  during  the  review  of \\n\\nits  business  plan  conducted  under  paragraph \\n(E) of this appendix. Such forecast should be \\nincluded  in  the  participant’s  business  plan. \\nThe forecast should include: \\n\\n(1) The aggregate dollar value of contracts \\nto be sought under the DBE program, reflect-\\ning compliance with the business plan; \\n\\n(2) The aggregate dollar value of contracts \\nto  be  sought  in  areas  other  than  traditional \\nareas of DBE participation; \\n\\n(3)  The  types  of  contract  opportunities \\nbeing  sought,  based  on  the  firm’s  primary \\nline of business; and \\n\\n(4)  Such  other  information  as  may  be  re-\\nquested  by  the  recipient  to  aid  in  providing \\neffective  business  development  assistance  to \\nthe participant. \\n\\n(G)  Program  participation  is  divided  into \\ntwo stages; (1) a developmental stage and (2) \\na  transitional  stage.  The  developmental \\nstage  is  designed  to  assist  participants  to \\novercome  their  social  and  economic  dis-\\nadvantage  by  providing  such  assistance  as \\nmay  be  necessary  and  appropriate  to  enable \\nthem  to  access  relevant  markets  and \\nstrengthen  their  financial  and  managerial \\nskills. The transitional stage of program par-\\nticipation  follows  the  developmental  stage \\nand  is  designed  to  assist  participants  to \\novercome,  insofar  as  practical,  their  social \\nand  economic  disadvantage  and  to  prepare \\nthe participant for leaving the program. \\n\\n(H)  The  length  of  service  in  the  program \\nterm  should  not  be  a  pre-set  time  frame  for \\neither  the  developmental  or  transitional \\nstages  but  should  be  figured  on  the  number \\nof years considered necessary in normal pro-\\ngression  of  achieving  the  firm’s  established \\ngoals  and  objectives.  The  setting  of  such \\ntime could be factored on such items as, but \\nnot  limited  to,  the  number  of  contracts,  ag-\\ngregate  amount  of  the  contract  received, \\nyears in business, growth potential, etc. \\n\\n(I) Beginning in the first year of the transi-\\ntional  stage  of  program  participation,  each \\nparticipant  should  annually  submit  for  in-\\nclusion in its business plan a transition man-\\nagement plan outlining specific steps to pro-\\nmote  profitable  business  operations  in  areas \\nother  than  traditional  areas  of  DBE  partici-\\npation  after  graduation  from  the  program. \\nThe  transition  management  plan  should  be \\nsubmitted to the recipient at the same time \\nother  modifications  are  submitted  pursuant \\nto  the  annual  review  under  paragraph  (E)  of \\nthis  section.

Recipients  will  consider \\nany  relevant  evidence  in  assessing  this  ele-\\nment. In every case, however, recipients will \\nconsider  education,  employment  and  busi-\\nness  history,  where  applicable,  to  see  if  the \\ntotality  of  circumstances  shows  disadvan-\\ntage  in  entering  into  or  advancing  in  the \\nbusiness world. \\n\\n(1) Education. Recipients will consider such \\nfactors  as  denial  of  equal  access  to  institu-\\ntions  of  higher  education  and  vocational \\ntraining,  exclusion  from  social  and  profes-\\nsional association with students or teachers, \\ndenial  of  educational  honors  rightfully \\nearned,  and  social  patterns  or  pressures \\nwhich  discouraged  the  individual  from  pur-\\nsuing a professional or business education. \\n\\n(2)  Employment.  Recipients  will  consider \\nsuch factors as unequal treatment in hiring, \\npromotions and other aspects of professional \\nadvancement,  pay  and  fringe  benefits,  and \\nother  terms  and  conditions  of  employment; \\nretaliatory or discriminatory behavior by an \\nemployer or labor union; and social patterns \\nor  pressures  which  have  channeled  the  indi-\\nvidual  into  non-professional  or  non-business \\nfields. \\n\\ncommercially \\n\\n(3) Business history. The recipient will con-\\nsider such factors as unequal access to credit \\nor  capital,  acquisition  of  credit  or  capital \\nunder \\ncir-\\ncumstances,  unequal  treatment  in  opportu-\\nnities  for  government  contracts  or  other \\nwork,  unequal  treatment  by  potential  cus-\\ntomers  and  business  associates,  and  exclu-\\nsion  from  business  or  professional  organiza-\\ntions. \\n\\nunfavorable \\n\\nII.  With  respect  to  paragraph  I.(A)  of  this \\nappendix,  the  Department  notes  that  people \\nwith disabilities have disproportionately low \\nincomes  and  high  rates  of  unemployment. \\nMany  physical  and  attitudinal  barriers  re-\\nmain to their full participation in education, \\nemployment,  and  business  opportunities \\navailable  to  the  general  public.  The  Ameri-\\ncans  with  Disabilities  Act  (ADA)  was  passed \\nin recognition of the discrimination faced by \\npeople  with  disabilities.  It  is  plausible  that \\nmany  individuals  with  disabilities—espe-\\ncially  persons  with  severe  disabilities  (e.g., \\nsignificant  mobility,  vision,  or  hearing  im-\\n\\npairments)—may  be  socially  and  economi-\\ncally disadvantaged. \\n\\nIII.  Under  the  laws  concerning  social  and \\neconomic  disadvantage,  people  with  disabil-\\nities  are  not  a  group  presumed  to  be  dis-\\nadvantaged.  Nevertheless,  recipients  should \\nlook  carefully  at  individual  showings  of  dis-\\nadvantage  by  individuals  with  disabilities, \\nmaking  a  case-by-case \\njudgment  about \\nwhether  such  an  individual  meets  the  cri-\\nteria of this appendix. As public entities sub-\\nject  to  Title  II  of  the  ADA,  recipients  must \\nalso  ensure  their  DBE  programs  are  acces-\\nsible to individuals with disabilities. For ex-\\nample, physical barriers or the lack of appli-\\ncation  and  information  materials  in  acces-\\nsible  formats  cannot  be  permitted  to  thwart \\nthe access of potential applicants to the cer-\\ntification  process  or  other  services  made \\navailable to DBEs and applicants. \\n\\nECONOMIC DISADVANTAGE \\n\\n(A)  General.  Economically  disadvantaged \\nindividuals  are  socially  disadvantaged  indi-\\nviduals  whose  ability  to  compete  in  the  free \\nenterprise  system  has  been  impaired  due  to \\ndiminished  capital  and  credit  opportunities \\nas compared to others in the same or similar \\nline  of  business  who  are  not  socially  dis-\\nadvantaged. \\n\\n(B)  Submission  of  narrative  and  financial  in-\\nformation.  (1)  Each  individual  claiming  eco-\\nnomic disadvantage must describe the condi-\\ntions  which  are  the  basis  for  the  claim  in  a \\nnarrative  statement,  and  must  submit  per-\\nsonal financial information. \\n\\n(2) [Reserved] \\n(C)  Factors  to  be  considered.  In  considering \\ndiminished  capital  and  credit  opportunities, \\nrecipients  will  examine  factors  relating  to \\nthe  personal  financial  condition  of  any  indi-\\nvidual  claiming  disadvantaged  status,  in-\\ncluding  personal  income  for  the  past  two \\nyears  (including  bonuses  and  the  value  of \\ncompany  stock  given  in  lieu  of  cash),  per-\\nsonal net worth, and the fair market value of \\nall  assets,  whether  encumbered  or  not.  Re-\\ncipients will also consider the financial con-\\ndition  of  the  applicant  compared  to  the  fi-\\nnancial  profiles  of  small  businesses  in  the \\nsame  primary  industry  classification,  or,  if \\nnot  available,  in  similar  lines  of  business, \\nwhich  are  not  owned  and  controlled  by  so-\\ncially  and  economically  disadvantaged  indi-\\nviduals  in  evaluating  the  individual’s  access \\nto  credit  and  capital.  The  financial  profiles \\nthat  recipients  will  compare  include  total \\nassets,  net  sales,  pre-tax  profit,  sales/work-\\ning capital ratio, and net worth. \\n\\n(D) Transfers within two years. (1) Except as \\nset forth in paragraph (D)(2) of this appendix, \\nrecipients  will  attribute  to  an  individual \\nclaiming  disadvantaged  status  any  assets \\nwhich  that  individual  has  transferred  to  an \\nimmediate  family  member,  or  to  a  trust,  a \\nbeneficiary  of  which  is  an  immediate  family \\nmember,  for  less  than  fair  market  value, \\n\\n299 \\n\\nVerDate

The  Tribe \\nshould  consider  consolidating  or  sepa-\\nrating out procurement to obtain more \\neconomical  purchases.  Tribes  are  en-\\ncouraged  to  realize  economies  of  scale \\nin  the  procurement  of  goods,  services, \\nand  supplies  under  this  part,  including \\nthe  negotiation  of  cooperative  agree-\\nments  with  other  public  authorities. \\nWhere  appropriate,  the  Tribe  must \\ncompare  leasing  and  purchasing  alter-\\n\\nnatives to determine which is more ec-\\nonomical. \\n\\n(4)  A  Tribe  must  conduct  all  major \\nprocurement  transactions  that  exceed \\nthe simplified acquisition threshold set \\nforth  in  2  CFR  200.88  by  providing  full \\nand  open  competition  to  the  extent \\nnecessary  to  assure  efficient  expendi-\\nture  of  contract  funds  and  to  the  ex-\\ntent feasible in the local area. \\n\\n(i)  Consistent  with  2  CFR  200.88,  a \\nTribe  may  develop  its  own  definition \\nfor a simplified acquisition threshold. \\n\\n(ii) To the greatest extent feasible, a \\nTribe  must  apply  to  any  procurement \\naward  the  Indian  preference  require-\\nments  for  wages  and  grants  contained \\nin 25 U.S.C. 5307(b). \\n\\n(5)  A  Tribe  must  make  procurement \\nawards  only  to  responsible  entities \\nwith  the  ability  to  perform  success-\\nfully under the terms and conditions of \\nthe  proposed  procurement.  In  making \\nthis  judgment,  the  Tribe  will  consider \\nsuch matters as the contractor’s integ-\\nrity, its compliance with public policy, \\nits  record  of  past  performance,  and  its \\nfinancial and technical resources. \\n\\n(6) A Tribe must maintain records on \\nthe significant history of all major pro-\\ncurement  transactions.

These issues include, but \\nare  not  limited  to,  source  evaluation, \\nprotests, disputes, and claims. \\n\\n(i) The settlement of any protest, dis-\\npute,  or  claim  will  not  relieve  the \\nTribe  of  any  obligations  under  a  fund-\\ning agreement. \\n\\n(ii) Violations of law must be referred \\nto the Tribal or Federal authority hav-\\ning proper jurisdiction. \\n\\n(b)  Conflicts  of  interest.

Similarly, DX-rated or-\\nders must be given preference over DO- \\nrated  orders  and  unrated  orders.  (Ex-\\namples: If a person receives a DO-rated \\norder  with  a  delivery  date  of  June  3 \\nand  if  meeting  that  date  would  mean \\ndelaying  production  or  delivery  of  an \\nitem  for  an  unrated  order,  the  unrated \\norder  must  be  delayed.

For  any  rated \\norder  against  which  delivery  or  per-\\nformance  will  be  delayed,  the  person \\nmust  notify  the  customer  as  provided \\nin § 33.33. \\n\\n(d)  If  a  person  is  unable  to  purchase \\nneeded production items in time to fill \\na  rated  order  by  its  required  delivery \\ndate,  the  person  must  fill  the  rated \\norder  by  using  inventoried  production \\nitems.  A  person  who  uses  inventoried \\nitems to fill a rated order may  replace \\nthose  items  with  the  use  of  a  rated \\norder as provided in § 33.37(b). \\n\\n§ 33.35 Extension of priority ratings. \\n\\n(a)  A  person  must  use  rated  orders \\nwith  suppliers  to  obtain  items  or  serv-\\nices  needed  to  fill  a  rated  order.  The \\nperson must use the priority rating in-\\ndicated  on  the  customer’s  rated  order, \\nexcept  as  otherwise  provided  in  this \\npart  or  as  directed  by  the  Department \\nof  Transportation.  For  example,  if  a \\nperson is in receipt of a DO–T1 priority \\nrating  for  a  bus  and  has  several  buses \\nin inventory that are in need of repair, \\nthat  person  must  use  a  DO–T1  rated \\norder to obtain the needed bus repairs. \\n(b)  The  priority  rating  must  be  in-\\ncluded  on  each  successive  order  placed \\nto  obtain  items  or  services  needed  to \\nfill a customer’s rated order. This con-\\ntinues  from  contractor  to  subcon-\\ntractor  to  supplier  throughout  the  en-\\ntire procurement chain. \\n\\n§ 33.36 Changes or cancellations of pri-\\nority ratings and rated orders. \\n\\n(a)  The  priority  rating  on  a  rated \\n\\norder may be changed or canceled by: \\n\\n(1)  An  official  action  of  the  Depart-\\n\\nment of Transportation; or \\n\\n(2) Written notification from the per-\\n\\nson who placed the rated order. \\n\\n(b) If an unrated order is amended so \\nas  to  make  it  a  rated  order,  or  a  DO \\nrating  is  changed  to  a  DX  rating,  the \\nsupplier  must  give  the  appropriate \\npreferential  treatment  to  the  order  as \\nof  the  date  the  change  is  received  by \\nthe supplier. \\n\\n(c)  An  amendment  to  a  rated  order \\nthat  significantly  alters  a  supplier’s \\noriginal  production  or  delivery  sched-\\nule  shall  constitute  a  new  rated  order \\nas  of  the  date  of  its  receipt.  The  sup-\\nplier  must  accept  or  reject  the  amend-\\ned  order  according  to  the  provisions  of \\n§ 33.33. \\n\\n(d) The following amendments do not \\nconstitute  a  new  rated  order:  a  change \\nin  shipping  destination;  a  reduction  in \\nthe  total  amount  of  the  order;  an  in-\\ncrease in the total amount of the order \\nwhich  has  negligible  impact  upon  de-\\nliveries; a minor variation in size or de-\\nsign; or a change which is agreed upon \\nbetween the supplier and the customer. \\n(e)  If  a  person  no  longer  needs  items \\nor  services  to  fill  a  rated  order,  any \\nrated  orders  placed  with  suppliers  for \\nthe  items  or  services,  or  the  priority \\nrating  on  those  orders,  must  be  can-\\nceled. \\n\\n(f) When a priority rating is added to \\nan unrated order, or is changed or can-\\nceled,  all  suppliers  must  be  promptly \\nnotified in writing. \\n\\n§ 33.37 Use of rated orders. \\n\\n(a) A person must use rated orders to \\n\\nobtain: \\n\\n(1) Items which will be physically in-\\ncorporated  into  other  items  to  fill \\nrated  orders,  including  that  portion  of \\nsuch  items  normally  consumed  or  con-\\nverted into scrap or by-products in the \\ncourse of processing; \\n\\n(2)  Containers  or  other  packaging \\nmaterials required to make delivery of \\nthe finished items against rated orders; \\n(3)  Services,  other  than  contracts  of \\nemployment,  needed  to  fill  rated  or-\\nders; and \\n\\n(4)  MRO  needed  to  produce  the  fin-\\n\\nished items to fill rated orders. \\n\\n(b) A person may use a rated order to \\nreplace  inventoried  items  (including \\nfinished items) if such items were used \\nto fill rated orders, as follows: \\n\\n413 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00423 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0c§ 33.38 \\n\\n49 CFR Subtitle A (10–1–21 Edition) \\n\\n(1)  The  order  must  be  placed  within \\n90 days of the date of use of the inven-\\ntory. \\n\\n(2)  A  DO  rating  and  the  program \\nidentification  symbol  indicated  on  the \\ncustomer’s rated order must be used on \\nthe order.

Compulsory \\nprocess means the institution of appro-\\npriate  legal  action,  including  ex  parte \\napplication  for  an  inspection  warrant \\nor  its  equivalent,  in  any  forum  of  ap-\\npropriate jurisdiction. \\n\\n(b)  Compulsory  process  may  be \\nsought  in  advance  of  an  audit,  inves-\\ntigation,  or  other  inquiry,  if,  in  the \\njudgment  of  the  Department  of  Trans-\\nportation  there  is  reason  to  believe \\nthat  a  person  will  refuse  to  permit  an \\naudit,  investigation,  or  other  inquiry, \\nor  that  other  circumstances  exist \\nwhich  make  such  process  desirable  or \\nnecessary. \\n\\n§ 33.73 Notification  of  failure  to  com-\\n\\nply. \\n\\n(a) At the conclusion of an audit, in-\\nvestigation, or other inquiry, or at any \\nother  time,  the  Department  of  Trans-\\nportation  may  inform  the  person  in \\nwriting  where  compliance  with  the  re-\\nquirements  of  the  Defense  Production \\nAct  and  other  applicable  statutes,  this \\npart,  or  an  official  action  were  not \\nmet. \\n\\n(b) In cases where the Department of \\nTransportation determines that failure \\nto  comply  with  the  provisions  of  the \\nDefense  Production  Act  and  other  ap-\\nplicable  statutes,  this  part,  or  an  offi-\\ncial action was inadvertent, the person \\nmay be informed in writing of the par-\\nticulars involved and the corrective ac-\\ntion  to  be  taken.  Failure  to  take  cor-\\nrective  action  may  then  be  construed \\nas  a  willful  violation  of  the  Defense \\n\\nProduction  Act  and  other  applicable \\nstatutes,  this  part,  or  an  official  ac-\\ntion. \\n\\n§ 33.74 Violations,  penalties,  and  rem-\\n\\nedies. \\n\\n(a) Willful violation of the provisions \\nof title 1 or section 705 or 707 of the De-\\nfense  Production  Act,  the  priorities \\nprovisions of the Selective Service Act, \\nthis  part,  or  an  official  action,  is  a \\ncrime  and  upon  conviction,  a  person \\nmay  be  punished  by  fine  or  imprison-\\nment,  or  both.  The  maximum  penalty \\ncurrently provided by the Defense Pro-\\nduction  Act  is  a  $10,000  fine,  or  one \\nyear  in  prison,  or  both.  The  maximum \\npenalty  currently  provided  by  the  Se-\\nlective  Service  Act  is  a  $50,000  fine,  or \\nthree years in prison, or both. \\n\\n(b) The Government may also seek an \\ninjunction  from  a  court  of  appropriate \\njurisdiction  to  prohibit  the  continu-\\nance  of  any  violation  of,  or  to  enforce \\ncompliance  with,  the  Defense  Produc-\\ntion  Act,  this  part,  or  an  official  ac-\\ntion. \\n\\n(c) In order to secure the effective en-\\nforcement  of  the  Defense  Production \\nAct  and  other  applicable  statutes,  this \\npart, and official actions, the following \\nare prohibited: \\n\\n(1)  No  person  may  solicit,  influence \\nor  permit  another  person  to  perform \\nany  act  prohibited  by,  or  to  omit  any \\nact  required  by,  the  Defense  Produc-\\ntion Act and other applicable statutes, \\nthis part, or an official action. \\n\\n(2)  No  person  may  conspire  or  act  in \\nconcert  with  any  other  person  to  per-\\nform any act prohibited by, or to omit \\nany  act  required  by,  the  Defense  Pro-\\nduction  Act  and  other  applicable  stat-\\nutes, this part, or an official action. \\n\\n(3)  No  person  shall  deliver  any  item \\nor  perform  any  service  if  the  person \\nknows or has reason to believe that the \\nitem  will  be  accepted,  redelivered, \\nheld,  or  used  in  violation  of  the  De-\\nfense  Production  Act  and  other  appli-\\ncable  statutes,  this  part,  or  an  official \\naction.

In  determining  whether \\nto  grant  such  a  request,  the  Secretary \\nconsiders the following factors: \\n\\n(1)  Whether  the  operator  has  pur-\\nchased or leased, since October 30, 2000, \\nenough  new  OTRBs  to  replace  50  per-\\ncent  of  the  OTRBs  with  which  it  pro-\\nvides fixed-route service by October 30, \\n2006  or  100  percent  of  such  OTRBs  by \\nOctober 29, 2012; \\n\\n(2)  Whether  the  operator  has  pur-\\nchased  or  leased,  between  October  28, \\n1998  and  October  30,  2000,  a  number  of \\nnew  inaccessible  OTRBs  significantly \\nexceeding the number of buses it would \\nnormally obtain in such a period; \\n\\n(3)  The  compliance  with  all  require-\\nments of this part by the operator over \\nthe period between October 28, 1998 and \\nthe request for time extension. \\n\\n§ 37.187 Interline service. \\n\\n(a)  When  the  general  public  can  pur-\\nchase  a  ticket  or  make  a  reservation \\nwith one operator for a fixed-route trip \\nof two or more stages in which another \\noperator  provides  service,  the  first  op-\\nerator  must  arrange  for  an  accessible \\nbus,  or  equivalent  service,  as  applica-\\nble, to be provided for each stage of the \\ntrip  to  a  passenger  with  a  disability. \\nThe  following  examples  illustrate  the \\nprovisions of this paragraph (a): \\n\\nExample 1. By going to Operator X’s ticket \\noffice  or  calling  X  for  a  reservation,  a  pas-\\nsenger  can  buy  or  reserve  a  ticket  from \\nPoint  A  through  to  Point  C,  transferring  at \\nintermediate  Point  B  to  a  bus  operated  by \\nOperator  Y.  Operator  X  is  responsible  for \\ncommunicating  immediately  with  Operator \\n\\nY  to  ensure  that  Y  knows  that  a  passenger \\nneeding  accessible  transportation  or  equiva-\\nlent  service,  as  applicable,  is  traveling  from \\nPoint  B  to  Point  C.  By  immediate  commu-\\nnication, we mean that the ticket or reserva-\\ntion  agent  for  Operator  X,  by  phone,  fax, \\ncomputer,  or  other  instantaneous  means, \\ncontacts Operator Y the minute the reserva-\\ntion  or  ticketing  transaction  with  the  pas-\\nsenger, as applicable, has been completed. It \\nis  the  responsibility  of  each  carrier  to  know \\nhow  to  contact  carriers  with  which  it \\ninterlines (e.g., Operator X must know Oper-\\nator Y’s phone number). \\n\\nExample  2.  Operator  X  fails  to  provide  the \\nrequired  information  in  a  timely  manner  to \\nOperator  Y.  Operator  X  is  responsible  for \\ncompensating  the  passenger  for  the  con-\\nsequent  unavailability  of  an  accessible  bus \\nor  equivalent  service,  as  applicable,  on  the \\nB-C leg of the interline trip. \\n\\n(b) Each operator retains the respon-\\nsibility  for  providing  the  transpor-\\ntation  required  by  this  subpart  to  the \\npassenger for its portion of an interline \\ntrip.  The  following  examples  illustrate \\nthe provisions of this paragraph (b): \\n\\nExample 1. In Example 1 to paragraph (a) of \\nthis  section,  Operator  X  provides  the  re-\\nquired information to Operator Y in a timely \\nfashion. However, Operator Y fails to provide \\nan accessible bus or equivalent service to the \\npassenger  at  Point  B  as  the  rules  require. \\nOperator  Y  is  responsible  for  compensating \\nthe passenger as provided in § 37.199. \\n\\nExample  2.  Operator  X  provides  the  re-\\nquired information to Operator Y in a timely \\nfashion. However, the rules require Operator \\nY  to  provide  an  accessible  bus  on  48  hours’ \\nadvance  notice  (i.e.,  as  a  matter  of  interim \\nservice under § 37.193(a) or service by a small \\nmixed-service  operator  under  § 37.191),  and \\nthe  passenger  has  purchased  the  ticket  or \\nmade  the  reservation  for  the  interline  trip \\nonly  8  hours  before  Operator  Y’s  bus  leaves \\nfrom Point B to go to Point C.

If  Operator  Y  receives  a  message \\nfrom  Operator  X  on  its  answering  machine \\non  Friday  night,  notifying  Y  of  the  need  for \\nan accessible bus on Monday morning, it has \\nthe  responsibility  of  making  sure  that  the \\naccessible  bus  is  there  on  Monday  morning. \\nOperator Y is not excused from its obligation \\nbecause  no  one  checked  the  answering  ma-\\nchine over the weekend. \\n\\n§ 37.189 Service requirement for OTRB \\n\\ndemand-responsive systems. \\n\\n(a) This section applies to private en-\\ntities  primarily  in  the  business  of \\ntransporting  people,  whose  operations \\naffect  commerce,  and  that  provide  de-\\nmand-responsive  OTRB  service.  Except \\nas  needed  to  meet  the  other  require-\\nments of this section, these entities are \\nnot required to purchase or lease acces-\\nsible  buses  in  connection  with  pro-\\nviding demand-responsive service. \\n\\n(b)  Demand-responsive \\n\\noperators \\nshall  ensure  that,  beginning  one  year \\nfrom  the  date  on  which  the  require-\\nments of this subpart begin to apply to \\nthe  entity,  any  individual  with  a  dis-\\nability  who  requests  service  in  an  ac-\\ncessible  OTRB  receives  such  service. \\nThis  requirement  applies  to  both  large \\nand small operators. \\n\\n(c) The operator may require up to 48 \\nhours’  advance  notice  to  provide  this \\nservice. \\n\\n(d) If the individual with a disability \\ndoes not provide the advance notice the \\noperator  requires  under  paragraph  (a) \\nof  this  section,  the  operator  shall  nev-\\nertheless  provide  the  service  if  it  can \\ndo so by making a reasonable effort. \\n\\n(e)  To  meet  this  requirement,  an  op-\\nerator is not required to fundamentally \\nalter its normal reservation policies or \\nto  displace  another  passenger  who  has \\nreserved  a  seat  on  the  bus.  The  fol-\\nlowing  examples  illustrate  the  provi-\\nsions of this paragraph (e): \\n\\nExample 1. A tour bus operator requires all \\npassengers to reserve space on the bus three \\nmonths  before  the  trip  date.  This  require-\\nment  applies  to  passengers  with  disabilities \\non  the  same  basis  as  other  passengers.  Con-\\nsequently,  an  individual  passenger  who  is  a \\nwheelchair user would have to request an ac-\\n\\ncessible  bus  at  the  time  he  or  she  made  his \\nreservation, at least three months before the \\ntrip  date.  If  the  individual  passenger  with  a \\ndisability  makes  a  request  for  space  on  the \\ntrip  and  an  accessible  OTRB  48  hours  before \\nthe  trip  date,  the  operator  could  refuse  the \\nrequest because all passengers were required \\nto  make  reservations  three  months  before \\nthe trip date. \\n\\nExample 2. A group makes a reservation to \\ncharter  a  bus  for  a  trip  four  weeks  in  ad-\\nvance. A week before the trip date, the group \\ndiscovers that someone who signed up for the \\ntrip is a wheelchair user who needs an acces-\\nsible  bus,  or  someone  who  later  buys  a  seat \\nin  the  block  of  seats  the  group  has  reserved \\nneeds an accessible bus. A group representa-\\ntive  or  the  passenger  with  a  disability  in-\\nforms  the  bus  company  of  this  need  more \\nthan  48  hours  before  the  trip  date.  The  bus \\ncompany must provide an accessible bus. \\n\\nExample  3.  While  the  operator’s  normal \\ndeadline  for  reserving  space  on  a  charter  or \\ntour trip has passed, a number of seats for a \\ntrip are unfilled. The operator permits mem-\\nbers  of  the  public  to  make  late  reservations \\nfor  the  unfilled  seats.  If  a  passenger  with  a \\ndisability  calls  48  hours  before  the  trip  is \\nscheduled  to  leave  and  requests  a  seat  and \\nthe provision of an accessible OTRB, the op-\\nerator  must  meet  this  request,  as  long  as  it \\ndoes  not  displace  another  passenger  with  a \\nreservation. \\n\\nExample  4.  A  tour  bus  trip  is  nearly  sold \\nout  three  weeks  in  advance  of  the  trip  date. \\nA  passenger  with  a  disability  calls  48  hours \\nbefore  the  trip  is  scheduled  to  leave  and  re-\\nquests  a  seat  and  the  provision  of  an  acces-\\nsible OTRB.

This  change  was  made  to  ensure \\nconsistency between requirements under sec-\\ntion 504 and the ADA. Several caveats relat-\\ning  to  the  application  of  UFAS  (e.g.,  that \\nspaces not used by the public or likely to re-\\nsult  in  the  employment  of  individuals  with \\ndisabilities  would  not  have  to  meet  the \\nstandards)  have  been  deleted.  It  is  the  De-\\npartment’s  understanding  that  provisions  of \\nthe Access Board standards and part 37 make \\nthem unnecessary. \\n\\nThe  Department  is  aware  that  there  is  a \\ntransition  period  between  the  publication  of \\nthis rule and the effective date of many of its \\nprovisions  (e.g.,  concerning  facilities  and \\nparatransit  services)  during  which  section \\n504  remains  the  basic  authority  for  accessi-\\nbility modifications. In this interval, the De-\\npartment  expects  recipients’  compliance \\nwith  section  504  to  look  forward  to  compli-\\nance  with  the  ADA  provisions.  That  is,  if  a \\nrecipient  is  making  a  decision  about  the \\nshape  of  its  paratransit  service  between  the \\npublication of this rule and January 26, 1992, \\nthe  decision  should  be  in  the  direction  of \\nservice  that  will  help  to  comply  with  post- \\nJanuary  1992  requirements.  A  recipient  that \\nseverely  curtailed  its  present  paratransit \\nservice  in  October,  and  then  asked  for  a \\nthree-  or  five-year  phase-in  of  service  under \\nits  paratransit  plan,  would  not  be  acting \\nconsistent with this policy. \\n\\nLikewise, the Department would view with \\ndisfavor any attempt by a recipient to accel-\\nerate  the  beginning  of  the  construction,  in-\\nstallation or alteration of a facility to before \\nJanuary  26,  1992,  to  ‘‘beat  the  clock’’  and \\navoid  the  application  of  this  rule’s  facility \\nstandards. The Department would be very re-\\nluctant to approve grants, contracts, exemp-\\ntion  requests  etc.,  that  appear  to  have  this \\neffect.  The  purpose  of  the  Department’s  ad-\\nministration of section 504 is to ensure com-\\npliance  with  the  national  policy  stated  in \\nthe ADA, not to permit avoidance of it. \\n\\nSUBPART A—GENERAL \\n\\nSection 37.3 Definitions \\n\\nThe  definition  of  ‘‘commuter  authority’’ \\nincludes  a  list  of  commuter  rail  operators \\ndrawn  from  a  statutory  reference  in  the \\nADA. It should be noted that this list is not \\nexhaustive.  Other  commuter  rail  operators \\n(e.g.,  in  Chicago  or  San  Francisco)  would \\nalso be encompassed by this definition. \\n\\nThe  definition  of  ‘‘commuter  bus  service’’ \\nis  important  because  the  ADA  does  not  re-\\nquire  complementary  paratransit  to  be  pro-\\nvided  with  respect  to  commuter  bus  service \\noperated  by  public  entities.  The  rationale \\n\\nthat  may  be  inferred  for  the  statutory  ex-\\nemption for this kind of service concerns its \\ntypical  characteristics  (e.g.,  no  attempt  to \\ncomprehensively  cover  a  service  area,  lim-\\nited route structure, limited origins and des-\\ntinations,  interface  with  another  mode  of \\ntransportation,  limited  purposes  of  travel). \\nThese  characteristics  can  be  found  in  some \\ntransportation  systems  other  than  bus  sys-\\ntems  oriented  toward  work  trips.  For  exam-\\nple,  bus  service  that  is  used  as  a  dedicated \\nconnecter  to  commuter  or  intercity  rail \\nservice, certain airport shuttles, and univer-\\nsity  bus  systems  share  many  or  all  of  these \\ncharacteristics.  As  explained  further  in  the \\ndiscussion of subpart B, the Department has \\ndetermined  that  it  is  appropriate  to  cover \\nthese  services  with  the  requirements  appli-\\ncable to commuter bus systems. \\n\\nThe  definitions  of \\n\\n‘‘designated  public \\ntransportation’’  and  ‘‘specified  public  trans-\\nportation’’  exclude  transportation  by  air-\\ncraft.  Persons  interested  in  matters  con-\\ncerning  access  to  air  travel  for  individuals \\nwith  disabilities  should  refer  to  14  CFR  part \\n382,  the  Department’s  regulation  imple-\\nmenting  the  Air  Carrier  Access  Act.  Since \\nthe facility requirements of this part refer to \\nfacilities  involved  in  the  provision  of  des-\\nignated  or  specified  public  transportation, \\nairport  facilities  are  not  covered  by  this \\npart.  DOJ  makes  clear  that  public  and  pri-\\nvate  airport  facilities  are  covered  under  its \\ntitle II and title III regulations, respectively. \\nThe  examples  given  in  the  definition  of \\n‘‘facility’’  all  relate  to  ground  transpor-\\ntation. We would point out that, since trans-\\nportation  by  passenger  vessels  is  covered  by \\nthis  rule  and  by  DOJ  rules,  such  vessel-re-\\nlated  facilities  as  docks,  wharfs,  vessel  ter-\\nminals,  etc.  fall  under  this  definition.  It  is \\nintended  that  specific  requirements  for  ves-\\nsels and related facilities will be set forth in \\nfuture rulemaking. \\n\\nThe  definitions  of  ‘‘fixed  route  system’’ \\nand  ‘‘demand  responsive  system’’  derive  di-\\nrectly  from  the  ADA’s  definitions  of  these \\nterms. Some systems, like a typical city bus \\nsystem or a dial-a-ride van system, fit clear-\\nly into one category or the other. Other sys-\\ntems  may  not  so  clearly  fall  into  one  of  the \\ncategories.  Nevertheless,  because  how  a  sys-\\ntem  is  categorized  has  consequences  for  the \\nrequirements it must meet, entities must de-\\ntermine,  on  a  case-by-case  basis,  into  which \\ncategory their systems fall. \\n\\nIn  making  this  determination,  one  of  the \\nkey  factors  to  be  considered  is  whether  the \\nindividual,  in  order  to  use  the  service,  must \\nrequest  the  service,  typically  by  making  a \\ncall. \\n\\nWith  fixed  route  service,  no  action  by  the \\nindividual is needed to initiate public trans-\\nportation.

Rept. 101–116 at 54). \\n\\nOther  factors,  such  as  the  presence  or  ab-\\nsence of published schedules, or the variation \\nof  vehicle  intervals  in  anticipation  of  dif-\\nferences in usage, are less important in mak-\\ning the distinction between the two types of \\nservice. If a service is provided along a given \\nroute,  and  a  vehicle  will  arrive  at  certain \\ntimes  regardless  of  whether  a  passenger  ac-\\ntively  requests  the  vehicle,  the  service  in \\nmost cases should be regarded as fixed route \\nrather than demand responsive. \\n\\nAt the same time, the fact that there is an \\ninteraction  between  a  passenger  and  trans-\\nportation  service  does  not  necessarily  make \\nthe  service  demand  responsive.  For  many \\ntypes of service (e.g., intercity bus, intercity \\nrail)  which  are  clearly  fixed  route,  a  pas-\\nsenger  has  to  interact  with  an  agent  to  buy \\na  ticket.  Some  services  (e.g.,  certain  com-\\nmuter bus or commuter rail operations) may \\nuse  flag  stops,  in  which  a  vehicle  along  the \\nroute  does  not  stop  unless  a  passenger  flags \\nthe  vehicle  down.  A  traveler  staying  at  a \\nhotel  usually  makes  a  room  reservation  be-\\nfore  hopping  on  the  hotel  shuttle.  This  kind \\nof  interaction  does  not  make  an  otherwise \\nfixed route service demand responsive. \\n\\nOn  the  other  hand,  we  would  regard  a  sys-\\ntem  that  permits  user-initiated  deviations \\nfrom  routes  or  schedules  as  demand-respon-\\nsive.  For  example,  if  a  rural  public  transit \\nsystem  (e.g.,  a  recipient  of  funds  under  49 \\nU.S.C.  5311)  has  a  few  fixed  routes,  the  fixed \\nroute portion of its system would be subject \\nto  the  requirements  of  subpart  F  for  com-\\nplementary paratransit service. If the entity \\nchanged  its  system  so  that  it  operated  as  a \\nroute-deviation  system,  we  would  regard  it \\nas  a  demand  responsive  system.  Such  a  sys-\\ntem  would  not  be  subject  to  complementary \\nparatransit requirements. \\n\\nThe  definition  of  ‘‘individual  with  a  dis-\\nability’’  excludes  someone  who  is  currently \\nengaging  in  the  illegal  use  of  drugs,  when  a \\ncovered entity is acting on the basis of such \\nuse.  This  concept  is  more  important  in  em-\\nployment  and  public  accommodations  con-\\ntexts than it is in transportation, and is dis-\\ncussed  at  greater  length  in  the  DOJ  and \\nEEOC  rules.  Essentially,  the  definition  says \\nthat, although drug addiction (i.e., the status \\nor  a  diagnosis  of  being  a  drug  abuser)  is  a \\ndisability, no one is regarded as being an in-\\ndividual with a disability on the basis of cur-\\nrent illegal drug use. \\n\\nMoreover,  even  if  an  individual  has  a  dis-\\nability,  a  covered  entity  can  take  action \\nagainst  the  individual  if  that  individual  is \\ncurrently  engaging  in  illegal  drug  use.  For \\nexample,  if  a  person  with  a  mobility  or  vi-\\n\\nsion impairment is ADA paratransit eligible, \\nbut  is  caught  possessing  or  using  cocaine  or \\nmarijuana on a paratransit vehicle, the tran-\\nsit  provider  can  deny  the  individual  further \\neligibility.  If  the  individual  has  successfully \\nundergone  rehabilitation  or  is  no  longer \\nusing drugs, as explained in the preamble to \\nthe DOJ rules, the transit provider could not \\ncontinue to deny eligibility on the basis that \\nthe individual was a former drug user or still \\nwas  diagnosed  as  a  person  with  a  substance \\nabuse problem. \\n\\nWe  defined  ‘‘paratransit’’  in  order  to  note \\nits specialized usage in the rule. Part 37 uses \\nthis  term  to  refer  to  the  complementary \\nparatransit  service  comparable  to  public \\nfixed route systems which must be provided. \\nTypically,  paratransit  is  provided  in  a  de-\\nmand  responsive  mode.  Obviously,  the  rule \\nrefers to a wide variety of demand responsive \\nservices  that  are  not  ‘‘paratransit,’’  in  this \\nspecialized sense. \\n\\nThe  ADA’s  definition  of  ‘‘over-the-road \\nbus’’  may  also  be  somewhat  narrower  than \\nthe common understanding of the term. The \\nADA definition focuses on a bus with an ele-\\nvated  passenger  deck  over  a  baggage  com-\\npartment  (i.e.,  a  ‘‘Greyhound-type’’  bus). \\nOther types of buses commonly referred to as \\n‘‘over-the-road  buses,’’  which  are  sometimes \\nused  for  commuter  bus  or  other  service,  do \\nnot  come  within  this  definition.  Only  buses \\nthat  do  come  within  the  definition  are  sub-\\nject to the over-the-road bus exception to ac-\\ncessibility  requirements  in  Title  III  of  the \\nADA. \\n\\nFor  terminological  clarity,  we  want  to \\npoint  out  that  two  different  words  are  used \\nin  ADA  regulations  to  refer  to  devices  on \\nwhich  individuals  with  hearing  impairments \\ncommunicate over telephone lines. DOJ uses \\nthe  more  traditional  term  ‘‘telecommuni-\\ncations  device  for  the  deaf’’  (TDD).  The  Ac-\\ncess  Board  uses  a  newer  term,  ‘‘text  tele-\\nphone.’’  The  DOT  rule  uses  the  terms \\ninterchangably. \\n\\nA  ‘‘used  vehicle’’  means  a  vehicle  which \\nhas prior use; prior, that is, to its acquisition \\nby its present owner or lessee. The definition \\nis  not  relevant  to  existing  vehicles  in  one’s \\nown  fleet,  which  were  obtained  before  the \\nADA vehicle accessibility requirements took \\neffect. \\n\\nA ‘‘vanpool’’ is a voluntary commuter ride-\\nsharing  arrangement  using  a  van  with  a \\nseating capacity of more than seven persons, \\nincluding  the  driver.  Carpools  are  not  in-\\ncluded in the definition. There are some sys-\\ntems  using  larger  vehicles  (e.g.,  buses)  that \\noperate,  in  effect,  as  vanpools.  This  defini-\\ntion  encompasses  such  systems.  Vanpools \\nare  used  for  daily  work  trips,  between  com-\\nmuters’  homes  (or  collection  points  near \\nthem)  and  work  sites  (or  drop  points  near \\nthem).

This inclu-\\nsiveness  is  consistent  with  the  legislative \\nhistory  of  the  ADA  (See  S.  Rept.  101–116  at \\n48).  While  some  mobility  devices  may  not \\nlook like many persons’ traditional idea of a \\nwheelchair, three- and more-wheeled devices, \\nof  many  varied  designs,  are  used  by  individ-\\nuals  with  disabilities  and  must  be  trans-\\nported.  ‘‘Wheelchair’’  is  defined  in  this  rule \\nas  a  mobility  aid  belonging  to  any  class  of \\nthree-or  more-wheeled  devices,  usable  in-\\ndoors,  designed  or  modified  for  and  used  by \\nindividuals  with  mobility \\nimpairments, \\nwhether  operated  manually  or  powered.  The \\n‘‘three-  or-more-wheeled’’  language  in  the \\ndefinition  is  intended  to  encompass  wheel-\\nchairs that may have additional wheels (e.g., \\ntwo  extra  guide  wheels  in  addition  to  the \\nmore traditional four wheels). \\n\\nPersons with mobility disabilities may use \\ndevices other than wheelchairs to assist with \\nlocomotion.  Canes,  crutches,  and  walkers, \\nfor  example,  are  often  used  by  people  whose \\nmobility  disabilities  do  not  require  use  of  a \\nwheelchair. These devices must be accommo-\\ndated on the same basis as wheelchairs. How-\\never,  the  Department  does  not  interpret  its \\nrules  to  require  transportation  providers  to \\naccommodate devices that are not primarily \\ndesigned  or  intended  to  assist  persons  with \\nmobility  disabilities (e.g.,  skateboards, bicy-\\ncles,  shopping  carts),  apart  from  general \\npolicies  applicable  to  all  passengers  who \\nmight seek to bring such devices into a vehi-\\ncle.  Similarly,  the  Department  does  not  in-\\nterpret  its  rules  to  require  transportation \\nproviders to permit an assistive device to be \\nused  in  a  way  that  departs  from  or  exceeds \\nthe  intended  purpose  of  the  device  (e.g.,  to \\nuse  a  walker,  even  one  with  a  seat  intended \\nto  allow  temporary  rest  intervals,  as  a \\nwheelchair  in  which  a  passenger  sits  for  the \\nduration of a ride on a transit vehicle). \\n\\nThe  definition  of  wheelchair  is  not  in-\\ntended to include a class of devices known as \\n‘‘other  power-driven  mobility  devices’’ \\n(OPMDs). OPMDs are defined in Department \\nof Justice ADA rules as ‘‘any mobility device \\npowered by batteries, fuel, or other engines— \\nwhether or not designed primarily for use by \\nindividuals  with  mobility  disabilities—that \\nis  used  by  individuals  with  mobility  disabil-\\nities for the purpose of locomotion, including \\ngolf  carts  * * *  Segway[s]® ,  or  any  mobility \\ndevice  designed  to  operate  in  areas  without \\ndefined  pedestrian  routes,  but  that  is  not  a \\nwheelchair  * * *  .’’  DOT  is  placing  guidance \\non  its  Web  site  concerning  the  use  of \\nSegways  in  transportation  vehicles  and  fa-\\ncilities. \\n\\nThe  definition  of  ‘‘direct  threat’’  is  in-\\ntended  to  be  interpreted  consistently  with \\nthe parallel definition in Department of Jus-\\ntice regulations. That is, part 37 does not re-\\n\\nquire a public entity to permit an individual \\nto participate in or benefit from the services, \\nprograms,  or  activities  of  that  public  entity \\nwhen that individual poses a direct threat to \\nthe  health  or  safety  of  others.  In  deter-\\nmining  whether  an  individual  poses  a  direct \\nthreat  to  the  health  or  safety  of  others,  a \\npublic  entity  must  make  an  individualized \\nassessment,  based  on  reasonable  judgment \\nthat  relies  on  current  medical  knowledge  or \\non  the  best  available  objective  evidence,  to \\nascertain: the nature, duration, and severity \\nof  the  risk;  the  probability  that  the  poten-\\ntial  injury  will  actually  occur;  and  whether \\nreasonable  modifications  of  policies,  prac-\\ntices, or procedures or the provision of auxil-\\niary aids or services will mitigate the risk. \\n\\nSection 37.5 Nondiscrimination \\n\\nThis  section  states  the  general  non-\\ndiscrimination  obligation  for  entities  pro-\\nviding  transportation  service.  It  should  be \\nnoted  that  virtually  all  public  and  private \\nentities  covered  by  this  regulation  are  also \\ncovered  by  DOJ  regulations,  which  have \\nmore  detailed  statements  of  general  non-\\ndiscrimination obligations. \\n\\nUnder the ADA, an entity may not consign \\nan individual with disabilities to a separate, \\n‘‘segregated,’’ service for such persons, if the \\nindividual can in fact use the service for the \\ngeneral  public.  This  is  true  even  if  the  indi-\\nvidual  takes  longer,  or  has  more  difficulty, \\nthan  other  persons  in  using  the  service  for \\nthe general public. \\n\\nOne  instance  in  which  this  principal  ap-\\nplies concerns the use of designated  priority \\nseats  (e.g.,  the  so-called  ‘‘elderly  and  handi-\\ncapped’’ seats near the entrances to buses). A \\nperson  with  a  disability  (e.g.,  a  visual  im-\\npairment)  may  choose  to  take  advantage  of \\nthis accommodation or not. If not, it is con-\\ntrary to rule for the entity to insist that the \\nindividual must sit in the priority seats. \\n\\nThe  prohibition  on  special  charges  applies \\nto charges for service to individuals with dis-\\nabilities that are higher than charges for the \\nsame  or  comparable  services  to  other  per-\\nsons.  For  example,  if  a  shuttle  service \\ncharges  $20.00  for  a  ride  from  a  given  loca-\\ntion  to  the  airport  for  most  people,  it  could \\nnot charge $40.00 because the passenger had a \\ndisability  or  needed  to  use  the  shuttle  serv-\\nice’s \\nlift-equipped  van.  Higher  mileage \\ncharges for using an accessible vehicle would \\nlikewise  be  inconsistent  with  the  rule.  So \\nwould  charging  extra  to  carry  a  service  ani-\\nmal  accompanying  an  individual  with  a  dis-\\nability. \\n\\nIf a taxi company charges $1.00 to stow lug-\\ngage  in  the  trunk,  it  cannot  charge  $2.00  to \\nstow  a  folding  wheelchair  there.  This  provi-\\nsion  does  not  mean,  however,  that  a  trans-\\nportation  provider  cannot  charge  non-\\ndiscriminatory  fees  to  passengers  with  dis-\\nabilities.

This  section  does  not  pro-\\nhibit  the  fares  for  paratransit  service  which \\ntransit providers are allowed to charge under \\n§ 37.131(d). \\n\\nA  requirement  for  an  attendant  is  incon-\\nsistent  with  the  general  nondiscrimination \\nprinciple  that  prohibits  policies  that  unnec-\\nessarily  impose  requirements  on  individuals \\nwith  disabilities  that  are  not  imposed  on \\nothers. Consequently,  such  requirements are \\nprohibited.  An  entity  is  not  required  to  pro-\\nvide  attendant  services  (e.g.,  assistance  in \\ntoileting, feeding, dressing), etc. \\n\\nThis  provision  must  also  be  considered  in \\nlight  of  the  fact  that  an  entity  may  refuse \\nservice  to  someone  who  engages  in  violent, \\nseriously disruptive, or illegal conduct. If an \\nentity  may  legitimately  refuse  service  to \\nsomeone, it may condition service to him on \\nactions  that  would  mitigate  the  problem. \\nThe  entity  could  require  an  attendant  as  a \\ncondition  of  providing  service  it  otherwise \\nhad the right to refuse. \\n\\nThe  rule  also  points  out  that  involuntary \\nconduct  related  to  a  disability  that  may  of-\\nfend  or  annoy  other  persons,  but  which  does \\nnot pose a direct threat, is not a basis for re-\\nfusal  of  transportation.  For  example,  some \\npersons with Tourette’s syndrome may make \\ninvoluntary  profane  exclamations.  These \\nmay be very annoying or offensive to others, \\nbut would not be a ground for denial of serv-\\nice. Nor would it be consistent with the non-\\ndiscrimination  requirements  of  this  part  to \\ndeny service based on fear or misinformation \\nabout  the  disability.  For  example,  a  transit \\nprovider  could  not  deny  service  to  a  person \\nwith  HIV  disease  because  its  personnel  or \\nother passengers are afraid of being near peo-\\nple with that condition. \\n\\nThis  section  also prohibits  denials of serv-\\nice  or  the  placing  on  services  of  conditions \\ninconsistent  with  this  part  on  individuals \\nwith  disabilities  because  of  insurance  com-\\npany  policies  or  requirements.  If  an  insur-\\nance company told a transit provider that it \\nwould withdraw coverage, or raise rates, un-\\nless  a  transit  provider  refused  to  carry  per-\\nsons with disabilities, or unless the provider \\nrefused to carry three-wheeled scooters, this \\nwould  not  excuse  the  provider  from  pro-\\nviding  the  service  as  mandate  by  this  part. \\nThis  is  not  a  regulatory  requirement  on  in-\\nsurance  companies,  but  simply  says  that \\ncovered entities must comply with this part, \\neven in the face of difficulties with their in-\\nsurance companies. \\n\\nSection 37.7 Standards for Accessible Vehicles \\n\\nThis  section  makes  clear  that,  in  order  to \\nmeet accessibility requirements of this rule, \\nvehicles  must  comply  with  Access  Board \\nstandards,  incorporated  in  DOT  rules  as  49 \\nCFR part 38. Paragraph (b) of § 37.7 spells out \\na  procedure  by  which  an  entity  (public  or \\nprivate)  can  deviate  from  provisions  of  part \\n\\n38 with respect to vehicles. The entity would \\nhave to describe how its alternative mode of \\ncompliance would meet or exceed the level of \\naccess  to  or  usability  of  the  vehicle  that \\ncompliance with part 38 would otherwise pro-\\nvide. \\n\\nIt should be noted that equivalent facilita-\\ntion does not provide a means to get a waiv-\\ner of accessibility requirements. Rather, it is \\na  way  in  which  comparable  (not  a  lesser  de-\\ngree  of)  accessibility  can  be  provided  by \\nother  means.  The  entity  must  consult  with \\nthe public through some means of public par-\\nticipation in devising its alternative form of \\ncompliance, and the public input must be re-\\nflected  in  the  submission  to  the  Adminis-\\ntrator  (or  the  Federal  Railroad  Adminis-\\ntrator in appropriate cases, such as a request \\nconcerning Amtrak). The Administrator will \\nmake  a  case-by-case  decision  about  whether \\ncompliance with part 38 was achievable  and, \\nif  not,  whether  the  proffered  alternative \\ncomplies  with  the  equivalent  facilitation \\nstandard.  DOT  intends  to  consult  with  the \\nAccess  Board  in  making  these  determina-\\ntions. \\n\\nThis  equivalent  facilitation  provision  can \\napply  to  buses  or  other  motor  vehicles  as \\nwell as to rail cars and vehicles. An example \\nof  what  could  be  an  equivalent  facilitation \\nwould  concern  rail  cars  which  would  leave \\ntoo  wide  a  horizontal  gap  between  the  door \\nand the platform. If the operator used a com-\\nbination  of  bridgeplates  and  personnel  to \\nbridge  the  gap,  it  might  be  regarded  as  an \\nequivalent  facilitation  in  appropriate  cir-\\ncumstances. \\n\\nSection  37.7(c)  clarifies  which  specifica-\\ntions  must  be  complied  with  for  over-the- \\nroad  buses  purchased  by  public  entities \\n(under  subpart  D  of  part  37)  or  private  enti-\\nties standing in the shoes of the public enti-\\nty (as described in § 37.23 of part 37). This sec-\\ntion  is  necessary  to  make  clear  that  over- \\nthe-road  coaches  must  be  accessible,  when \\nthey are purchased by or in furtherance of a \\ncontract  with  a  public  entity.  While  the  Oc-\\ntober 4, 1990 rule specified that over-the-road \\ncoaches  must  be  accessible  under  these  cir-\\ncumstances,  we  had  not  previously  specified \\nwhat constitutes accessibility. \\n\\nAccordingly,  this  paragraph  specifies  that \\nan  over-the-road  bus  must  have  a  lift  which \\nmeets  the  performance  requirements  of  a \\nregular  bus  lift  (see  § 38.23)  and  must  meet \\nthe  interim  accessibility  features  specified \\nfor all over-the-road buses in part 3, subpart \\nG. \\n\\nSection 37.9 Standards for Transportation \\nFacilities \\n\\nThis  section  makes  clear  that,  in  order  to \\nmeet accessibility requirements of this rule, \\nvehicles  must  comply  with  appendix  A  to \\npart 37, which incorporates the Access Board \\nfacility guidelines. \\n\\n484 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00494 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cOffice of the Secretary of Transportation \\n\\nPt. 37, App. D \\n\\nParagraph (b) of § 37.9 provides that, under \\ncertain  circumstances,  existing  accessibility \\nmodifications to key station facilities do not \\nneed  to  be  modified  further  in  order  to  con-\\nform  to  appendix  A.  This  is  true  even  if  the \\nstandards under which the facility was modi-\\nfied  differ  from  the  Access  Board  guidelines \\nor  provide  a  lesser  standard  of  accessibility. \\nTo qualify for this ‘‘grandfathering,’’ alter-\\nations  must  have  been  before  January  26, \\n1992. As in other facility sections of the rule, \\nan  alteration  is  deemed  to  begin  with  the \\nissuance  of  a  notice  to  proceed  or  work \\norder.  The  existing  modifications  must  con-\\nform  to  ANSI  A–117.1,  Specifications  for \\nMaking  Buildings  and  Facilities  Accessible \\nto and Usable by the Physically Handicapped \\n1980,  or  the  Uniform  Federal  Accessibility \\nStandard. (UFAS). \\n\\nFor  example,  if  an  entity  used  a  Federal \\ngrant  or  loan  or  money  to  make  changes  to \\na building, it would already have had to com-\\nply  with  the  Uniform  Federal  Accessibility \\nStandards. Likewise, if a private entity, act-\\ning  without  any  Federal  money  in  the \\nproject,  may  have  complied  with  the  ANSI \\nA117.1  standard.  So  long  as  the  work  was \\ndone  in  conformity  with  the  standard  that \\nwas in effect when the work was done, the al-\\nteration will be considered accessible. \\n\\nHowever,  because  one  modification  was \\nmade  to  a  facility  under  one  of  these  stand-\\nards,  the  entity  still  has  a  responsibility  to \\nmake  other  modifications  needed  to  comply \\nwith  applicable  accessibility  requirements. \\nFor  example,  if  an  entity  has  made  some \\nmodifications  to  a  key  station  according  to \\none  of  these  older  standards,  but  the  modi-\\nfications  do  not  make  the  key  station  en-\\ntirely  accessible  as  this  rule  requires,  then \\nadditional  modifications  would  have  to  be \\nmade according to the standards of appendix \\nA.  Suppose  this  entity  has  put  an  elevator \\ninto  the  station  to  make  it  accessible  to  in-\\ndividuals  who  use  wheelchairs.  If  the  eleva-\\ntor  does  not  fully  meet  appendix  A  stand-\\nards,  but  met  the  applicable  ANSI  standard \\nwhen it was installed, it would not need fur-\\nther modifications now. But if it had not al-\\nready  done  so,  the  entity  would  have  to  in-\\nstall  a  tactile  strip  along  the  platform  edge \\nin order to make the key station fully acces-\\nsible  as  provided  in  this  rule.  The  tactile \\nstrip would have to meet appendix A require-\\nments. \\nThe \\n\\nthat \\n‘‘grandfathering’’ applies only to alterations \\nof  individual  elements  and  spaces  and  only \\nto  the  extent  that  provisions  covering  those \\nelements  or  spaces  are  found  in  UFAS  or \\nAHSI A117.1. For example, alterations to the \\ntelephones  in  a  key  station  may  have  been \\ncarried  out  in  order  to  lower  them  to  meet \\nthe  requirements  of  UFAS,  but  tele-\\ncommunications  devices  for  the  deaf  (TDDs) \\nwere  not  installed.  (Neither  UFAS  nor  the \\nANSI  standard  include  requirements  con-\\n\\nspecifically  provides \\n\\nrule \\n\\ncerning TDDs). However, because appendix A \\ndoes contain TDD requirements, the key sta-\\ntion must now be altered in accordance with \\nthe standards for TDDs. Similarly, earlier al-\\nteration  of  an  entire  station  in  accordance \\nwith  UFAS  or  the  ANSI  standard  would  not \\nrelieve  an  entity  from  compliance  with  any \\napplicable  provision  concerning  the  gap  be-\\ntween  the  platform  between  the  platform \\nand the vehicle in a key station, because nei-\\nther  of  these  two  standards  addresses  the \\ninterface between vehicle and platform. \\n\\nOne  further  clarification  concerning  the \\nimplication of this provision deals with a bus \\nloading island at which buses pull up on both \\nsides  of  the  island.  It  would  be  possible  to \\nread the bus pad specification to require the \\nisland  to  be  a  minimum  of  84  inches  wide \\n(two widths of a bus stop pad), so that a lift \\ncould be deployed from buses on both sides of \\nthe  island  at  the  same  time.  A  double-wide \\nbus  pad,  however,  is  likely  to  exceed  avail-\\nable space in most instances. \\n\\nWhere  there  is  space,  of  course,  building  a \\ndouble-wide  pad  is  one  acceptable  option \\nunder this rule. However, the combination of \\na  pad  of  normal  width  and  standard  oper-\\national  practices  may  also  suffice.  (Such \\npractices  could  be  offered  as  an  equivalent \\nfacilitation.)  For  example,  buses  on  either \\nside of the island could stop at staggered lo-\\ncations  (i.e.,  the  bus  on  the  left  side  could \\nstop  several  feet  ahead  of  the  bus  on  the \\nright side), so that even when buses were on \\nboth  sides  of  the  island  at  once,  their  lifts \\ncould be deployed without conflict. Where it \\nis  possible,  building  the  pad  a  little  longer \\nthan normal size could facilitate such an ap-\\nproach.  In  a  situation  where  staggered  stop \\nareas  are  not  feasible,  an  operational  prac-\\ntice of having one bus wait until the other’s \\nlift  cycle  had  been  completed  could  do  the \\njob.  Finally,  the  specification  does  not  re-\\nquire  that  a  pad  be  built  at  all.  If  there  is \\nnothing  that  can  be  done  to  permit  lift  de-\\nployment  on  both  sides  of  an  island,  the \\nbuses  can  stop  on  the  street,  or  some  other \\nlocation, so long as the lift is deployable. \\n\\nLike  § 37.7,  this  section  contains  a  provi-\\nsion  allowing  an  entity  to  request  approval \\nfor providing accessibility through an equiv-\\nalent facilitation. \\n\\nSection 37.11 Administrative Enforcement \\n\\nThis  section  spells  out  administrative \\nmeans  of  enforcing  the  requirements  of  the \\nADA.  Recipients  of  Federal  financial  assist-\\nance  from  DOT  (whether  public  or  private \\nentities) are subject to DOT’s section 504 en-\\nforcement  procedures.  The  existing  proce-\\ndures,  including  administrative  complaints \\nto the DOT Office of Civil Rights, investiga-\\ntion,  attempts  at  conciliation,  and  final  re-\\nsort to proceedings to cut off funds to a non-\\ncomplying  recipient,  will  continue  to  be \\nused. \\n\\n485 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00495 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cPt. 37, App. D \\n\\n49 CFR Subtitle A (10–1–21 Edition) \\n\\nIn  considering  enforcement  matters,  the \\nDepartment  is  guided  by  a  policy  that  em-\\nphasizes compliance. The aim of enforcement \\naction, as we see it, is to make sure that en-\\ntities  meet  their  obligations,  not  to  impose \\nsanctions  for  their  own  sake.  The  Depart-\\nment’s enforcement priority is on failures to \\ncomply  with  basic  requirements  and  ‘‘pat-\\ntern  or  practice’’  kinds  of  problems,  rather \\nthan on isolated operational errors. \\n\\nUnder the DOJ rules implementing title II \\n\\nof the ADA (28 CFR part 35), DOT is a ‘‘des-\\nignated  agency’’  for  enforcement  of  com-\\nplaints  relating  to  transportation  programs \\nof public entities, even if they do not receive \\nFederal  financial  assistance.  When  it  re-\\nceives  such  a  complaint,  the  Department \\nwill investigate the complaint, attempt con-\\nciliation  and,  if  conciliation  is  not  possible, \\ntake action under section 504 and/or refer the \\nmatter  to  the  DOJ  for  possible  further  ac-\\ntion. \\n\\nTitle III of the ADA does not give DOT any \\nadministrative  enforcement  authority  with \\nrespect  to  private  entities  whose  transpor-\\ntation  services  are  subject  to  part  37.  In  its \\ntitle  III  rule  (28  CFR  part  36),  DOJ  assumes \\nenforcement  responsibility  for  all  title  III \\nmatters.  If  the  Department  of  Transpor-\\ntation  receives  complaints  of  violations  of \\npart  37  by  private  entities,  it  will  refer  the \\nmatters to the DOJ. \\n\\nIt  should  be  pointed  out  that  the  ADA  in-\\ncludes  other  enforcement  options.  Individ-\\nuals  have  a  private  right  of  action  against \\nentities  who  violate  the  ADA  and  its  imple-\\nmenting  regulations.  The  DOJ  can  take  vio-\\nlators  to  court.  These  approaches  are  not \\nmutually  exclusive  with  the  administrative \\nenforcement  mechanisms  described  in  this \\nsection.  An  aggrieved  individual  can  com-\\nplain  to  DOT  about  an  alleged  transpor-\\ntation violation and go to court at the same \\ntime. Use of administrative enforcement pro-\\ncedures is not, under titles II and III, an ad-\\nministrative  remedy  that  individuals  must \\nexhaust before taking legal action. \\n\\nWe also would point out that the ADA does \\nnot assert any blanket preemptive authority \\nover  state  or  local  nondiscrimination  laws \\nand enforcement mechanisms. While require-\\nments of the ADA and this regulation would \\npreempt conflicting state or local provisions \\n(e.g.,  a  building  code  or  zoning  ordinance \\nthat prevents compliance with appendix A or \\nother  facility  accessibility  requirements,  a \\nprovision  of  local  law  that  said  bus  drivers \\ncould  not  leave  their  seats  to  help  secure \\nwheelchair  users),  the  ADA  and  this  rule  do \\nnot prohibit states and localities from legis-\\nlating in areas relating to disability. For ex-\\nample, if a state law requires a higher degree \\nof  service  than  the  ADA,  that  requirement \\ncould  still  be  enforced.  Also,  states  and  lo-\\ncalities  may  continue  to  enforce  their  own \\nparallel requirements. For example, it would \\nbe a violation of this rule for a taxi driver to \\n\\nrefuse to pick up a person based on that per-\\nson’s disability. Such a refusal may also be a \\nviolation of a county’s taxi rules, subjecting \\nthe  violator  to  a  fine  or  suspension  of  oper-\\nating  privileges.  Both  ADA  and  local  rem-\\nedies could proceed in such a case. \\n\\nLabor-management  agreements \\n\\ncannot \\nstand  in  conflict  with  the  requirements  of \\nthe  ADA  and  this  rule.  For  example,  if  a \\nlabor-management  agreement  provides  that \\nvehicle  drivers  are  not  required  to  provide \\nassistance  to  persons  with  disabilities  in  a \\nsituation in which this rule requires such as-\\nsistance,  then  the  assistance  must  be  pro-\\nvided notwithstanding the agreement. Labor \\nand  management  do  not  have  the  authority \\nto  agree  to  violate  requirements  of  Federal \\nlaw. \\n\\nSection 37.13 Effective Date for Certain Vehicle \\nLift Specifications. \\n\\nThis  section  contains  an  explicit  state-\\nment  of  the  effective  date  for  vehicle  lift \\nplatform specifications. The Department has \\ndecided to apply the new part 38 lift platform \\nspecifications  to  solicitations  after  January \\n25, 1992. As in the October 4, 1990, rule imple-\\nmenting  the  acquisition  requirements;  the \\ndate  of  a  solicitation  is  deemed  to  be  the \\nclosing date for the submission of bids or of-\\nfers in a procurement. \\n\\nSUBPART B—APPLICABILITY \\n\\nSection 37.21 Applicability—General \\n\\nThis section emphasizes the broad applica-\\nbility of part 37. Unlike section 504, the ADA \\nand its implementing rules apply to entities \\nwhether  or  not  they  receive  Federal  finan-\\ncial  assistance.  They  apply  to  private  and \\npublic  entities  alike.  For  entities  which  do \\nreceive  Federal  funds,  compliance  with  the \\nADA and part 37 is a condition of compliance \\nwith  section  504  and  49  CFR  part  27,  DOT’s \\nsection 504 rule. \\n\\nVirtually  all  entities  covered  by  this  rule \\nalso  are  covered  by  DOJ  rules,  either  under \\n28  CFR  part  36  as  state  and  local  program \\nproviders  or  under  28  CFR  part  35  as  opera-\\ntors of places of public accommodation. Both \\nsets of rules apply; one does not override the \\nother. The DOT rules apply only to the enti-\\nty’s  transportation  facilities,  vehicles,  or \\nservices;  the  DOJ  rules  may  cover  the  enti-\\nty’s activities more broadly. For example, if \\na public entity operates a transit system and \\na  zoo,  DOT’s  coverage  would  stop  at  the \\ntransit  system’s  edge,  while  DOJ’s  rule \\nwould cover the zoo as well. \\n\\nDOT and DOJ have coordinated their rules, \\nand  the  rules  have  been  drafted  to  be  con-\\nsistent with one another. Should, in the con-\\ntext of some future situation, there be an ap-\\nparent  inconsistency  between  the  two  rules, \\nthe  DOT  rule  would  control  within  the \\nsphere  of  transportation  services,  facilities \\nand vehicles. \\n\\n486 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00496 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cOffice of the Secretary of Transportation \\n\\nPt. 37, App. D \\n\\nSection 37.23 Service Under Contract \\n\\nThis  section  requires  private  entities  to \\n‘‘stand  in  the  shoes’’  of  public  entities  with \\nwhom  they  contract  to  provide  transpor-\\ntation services. It ensures that, while a pub-\\nlic  entity  may  contract  out  its  service,  it \\nmay  not  contract  away  its  ADA  responsibil-\\nities.  The  requirement  applies  primarily  to \\nvehicle acquisition requirements and to serv-\\nice provision requirements. \\n\\nIf  a  public  entity  wishes  to  acquire  vehi-\\ncles  for  use  on  a  commuter  route,  for  exam-\\nple,  it  must  acquire  accessible  vehicles.  It \\nmay  acquire  accessible  over-the-road  buses, \\nit  may  acquire  accessible  full-size  transit \\nbuses,  it  may  acquire  accessible  smaller \\nbuses,  or  it  may  acquire  accessible  vans.  It \\ndoes  not  matter  what  kind  of  vehicles  it  ac-\\nquires, so long as they are accessible. On the \\nother hand, if the public entity wants to use \\ninaccessible buses in its existing fleet for the \\ncommuter service, it may do so. All replace-\\nment vehicles acquired in the future must, of \\ncourse, be accessible. \\n\\nUnder  this  provision,  a  private  entity \\nwhich  contracts  to  provide  this  commuter \\nservice stands in the shoes of the public enti-\\nty  and  is  subject  to  precisely  the  same  re-\\nquirements  (it  is  not  required  to  do  more \\nthan the public entity). If the private entity \\nacquires vehicles used to provide the service, \\nthe vehicles must be accessible. If it cannot, \\nor chooses not to, acquire an accessible vehi-\\ncle  of  one  type,  it  can  acquire  an  accessible \\nvehicle of another type. Like the public enti-\\nty,  it  can  provide  the  service  with  inacces-\\nsible vehicles in its existing fleet. \\n\\nThe  import  of  the  provision  is  that  it  re-\\nquires  a  private  entity  contracting  to  pro-\\nvide transportation service to a public entity \\nto  follow  the  rules  applicable  to  the  public \\nentity.  For  the  time  being,  a  private  entity \\noperating  in  its  own  right  can  purchase  a \\nnew  over-the-road  bus  inaccessible  to  indi-\\nviduals  who  use  wheelchairs.  When  that  pri-\\nvate  entity  operates  service  under  contract \\nto the public entity, however, it is just as ob-\\nligated as the public entity itself to purchase \\nan  accessible  bus  for  use  in  that  service, \\nwhether or not it is an over-the-road bus. \\n\\nThe  ‘‘stand  in  the  shoes’’  requirement  ap-\\nplies not only to vehicles acquired by private \\nentities  explicitly  under  terms  of  an  exe-\\ncuted contract to provide service to a public \\nentity, but also to vehicles acquired ‘‘in con-\\ntemplation  of  use’’  for  service  under  such  a \\ncontract. This language is included to ensure \\ngood  faith  compliance  with  accessibility  re-\\nquirements  for  vehicles  acquired  before  the \\nexecution  of  a  contract.  Whether  a  par-\\nticular acquisition is in contemplation of use \\non  a  contract  will  be  determined  on  a  case- \\nby-case basis. However, acquiring a vehicle a \\nshort time before a contract is executed and \\nthen using it for the contracted service is an \\nindication  that  the  vehicle  was  acquired  in \\n\\ncontemplation  of  use  on  the  contract,  as  is \\nacquiring  a  vehicle  obstensibly  for  other \\nservice provided by the entity and then regu-\\nlarly  rotating  it  into  service  under  the  con-\\ntract. \\n\\nThe  ‘‘stand  in  the  shoes’’  requirement  is \\napplicable  only  to  the  vehicles  and  service \\n(public  entity  service  requirements,  like \\n§ 37.163, apply to a private entity in these sit-\\nuations) provided  under  contract to a public \\nentity. Public entity requirements clearly do \\nnot  apply  to  all  phases  of  a  private  entity’s \\noperations,  just  because  it  has  a  contract \\nwith  a  public  entity.  For  example,  a  private \\nbus company, if purchasing buses for service \\nunder contract to a public entity, must pur-\\nchase  accessible  buses.  The  same  company, \\nto the extent permitted by the private entity \\nprovisions  of  this  part,  may  purchase  inac-\\ncessible  vehicles  for  its  tour  bus  operations. \\nThe  Department  also  notes  that  the \\n‘‘stands  in  the  shoes’’  requirement  may  dif-\\nfer  depending  on  the  kind  of  service  in-\\nvolved.  The  public  entity’s \\n‘‘shoes’’  are \\nshaped  differently,  for  example,  depending \\non  whether  the  public  entity  is  providing \\nfixed  route  or  demand  responsive  service  to \\nthe general public. In the case of demand re-\\nsponsive  service,  a  public  entity  is  not  re-\\nquired  to  buy  an  accessible  vehicle  if  its  de-\\nmand  responsive  system,  when  viewed  in  its \\nentirety, provides service to individuals with \\ndisabilities equivalent to its service to other \\npersons.  A  private  contractor  providing  a \\nportion of this paratransit service would not \\nnecessarily have to acquire an accessible ve-\\nhicle if this equivalency test is being met by \\nthe  system  as  a  whole.  Similarly,  a  public \\nentity can, after going through a ‘‘good faith \\nefforts’’ search, acquire inaccessible buses. A \\nprivate  entity  under  contract  to  the  public \\ncan  do  the  same.  ‘‘Stand  in  the  shoes’’  may \\nalso mean that, under some circumstances, a \\nprivate  contractor  need  not  acquire  acces-\\nsible  vehicles.  If  a  private  company  con-\\ntracts  with  a  public  school  district  to  pro-\\nvide school bus service, it is covered, for that \\npurpose,  by  the  exemption  for  public  school \\ntransportation. \\n\\nIn addition, the requirement that a private \\nentity play by the rules applicable to a pub-\\nlic  entity  can  apply  in  situations  involving \\nan ‘‘arrangement or other relationship’’ with \\na  public  entity  other  than  the  traditional \\ncontract  for  service.  For  example,  a  private \\nutility company that operates what is, in es-\\nsence,  a  regular  fixed  route  public  transpor-\\ntation  system  for  a  city,  and  which  receives \\nfunding under 49 U.S.C. 5307 or 49 U.S.C. 5309 \\nvia  an  agreement  with  a  state  or  local  gov-\\nernment  agency,  would  fall  under  the  provi-\\nsions  of  this  section.  The  provider  would \\nhave to comply with the vehicle acquisition, \\nparatransit,  and  service  requirements  that \\nwould  apply  to  the  public  entity  through \\n\\n487 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00497 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cPt. 37, App. D \\n\\n49 CFR Subtitle A (10–1–21 Edition) \\n\\nwhich it receives the FTA funds, if that pub-\\nlic entity operated the system itself. The De-\\npartment  would  not,  however,  construe  this \\nsection  to  apply  to  situations  in  which  the \\ndegree  of  FTA  funding  and  state  and  local \\nagency  involvement  is  considerably  less,  or \\nin  which  the  system  of  transportation  in-\\nvolved is not a de facto surrogate for a tradi-\\ntional  public  entity  fixed  route  transit  sys-\\ntem serving a city (e.g., a private non-profit \\nsocial  service  agency  which  receives  funds \\nunder 49 U.S.C. 5310 to purchase a vehicle). \\n\\nThis section also requires that a public en-\\ntity  not  diminish  the  percentage  of  acces-\\nsible  vehicles  in  its  fleet  through  con-\\ntracting. For example, suppose a public enti-\\nty  has  100  buses  in  its  fleet,  of  which  20  are \\naccessible,  meaning  that  20  percent  of  its \\nfleet is accessible. The entity decides to add \\na  fixed  route,  for  which  a  contractor  is  en-\\ngaged. The contractor is supplying ten of its \\nexisting  inaccessible  buses  for  the  fixed \\nroute.  To  maintain  the  20  percent  accessi-\\nbility ratio, there would have to be 22 acces-\\nsible  buses  out  of  the  110  buses  now  in  oper-\\nation  in  carrying  out  the  public  entity’s \\nservice. The public entity could maintain its \\n20  percent  level  of  accessibility  through  any \\none  or  more  of  a  number  of  means,  such  as \\nhaving  the  contractor  to  provide  two  acces-\\nsible buses, retrofitting two if its own exist-\\ning  buses,  or  accelerating  replacement  of \\ntwo of its own inaccessible buses with acces-\\nsible buses. \\n\\nThis  rule  applies  the  ‘‘stand  in  the  shoes’’ \\nprinciple  to  transactions  wholly  among  pri-\\nvate entities as well. For example, suppose a \\ntaxi company (a private entity primarily en-\\ngaged in the business of transporting people) \\ncontracts  with  a  hotel  to  provide  airport \\nshuttle  van  service.  With  respect  to  that \\nservice,  the  taxi  company  would  be  subject \\nto  the  requirements  for  private  entities  not \\nprimarily  in  the  business  of  transporting \\npeople,  since  it  would  be  ‘‘standing  in  the \\nshoes’’ of the hotel for that purpose. \\n\\nSection 37.25 University Transportation \\nSystems \\n\\nPrivate university-operated transportation \\nsystems  are  subject  to  the  requirements  of \\nthis  rule  for  private  entities  not  primarily \\nengaged  in  the  business  of  transporting  peo-\\nple.  With  one  important  exception,  public \\nuniversity-operated  transportation  systems \\nare  subject  to  the  requirements  of  the  rule \\nfor public entities. The nature of the systems \\nfixed \\ninvolved—demand-responsive \\nroute—determines  the  precise  requirements \\ninvolved. \\n\\nor \\n\\nFor  public  university  fixed  route  systems, \\npublic entity requirements apply. In the case \\nof  fixed  route  systems,  the  requirements  for \\ncommuter  bus  service  would  govern.  This \\nhas the effect of requiring the acquisition of \\naccessible  vehicles  and  compliance  with \\nmost  other  provisions  of  the  rule,  but  does \\n\\nnot  require  the  provision  of  complementary \\nparatransit or submitting a paratransit plan. \\nAs  a  result,  private  and  public  universities \\nwill  have  very  similar  obligations  under  the \\nrule. \\n\\nSection 37.27 Transportation for Elementary \\nand Secondary Education Systems \\n\\nThis section restates the statutory exemp-\\ntion  from  public  entity  requirements  given \\nto  public  school  transportation.  This  exten-\\nsion  also  applies  to  transportation  of  pre- \\nschool children to Head Start or special edu-\\ncation  programs  which  receive  Federal  as-\\nsistance. It also applies to arrangements per-\\nmitting  pre-school  children  of  school  bus \\ndrivers to ride a school bus or allowing teen-\\nage mothers to be transported to day care fa-\\ncilities  at  a  school  or  along  a  school  bus \\nroute so that their mothers may continue to \\nattend  school  (See  H.  Rept.  101–485,  pt.  1  at \\n27). The situation for private schools is more \\ncomplex.  According  to  the  provision,  a  pri-\\nvate elementary or secondary school’s trans-\\nportation  system  is  exempt  from  coverage \\nunder  this  rule  if  all  three  of  the  following \\nconditions  are  met:  (1)  The  school  receives \\nFederal financial assistance; (2) the school is \\nsubject  to  section  504;  and  (3)  the  school’s \\ntransportation  system  provides  transpor-\\ntation  services  to  individuals  with  disabil-\\nities,  including  wheelchair  users,  equivalent \\nto those provided to individuals without dis-\\nabilities. The test of equivalency is the same \\nas  that  for  other  private  entities,  and  is  de-\\nscribed  under  § 37.105.  If  the  school  does  not \\nmeet  all  these  criteria,  then  it  is  subject  to \\nthe requirements of Part 37 for private enti-\\nties not primarily engaged in the business of \\ntransporting people. \\n\\nThe Department notes that, given the con-\\nstitutional  law  on  church-state  separation, \\nit  is  likely  that  church-affiliated  private \\nschools  do  not  receive  Federal  financial  as-\\nsistance.  To  the  extent  that  these  schools’ \\ntransportation systems are operated by reli-\\ngious  entities  or  entities  controlled  by  reli-\\ngious  organizations,  they  are  not  subject  to \\nthe ADA at all, so this section does not apply \\nto them. \\n\\nSection 37.29 Private Providers of Taxi Service \\n\\nThis  section  first  recites  that  providers  of \\ntaxi  service  are  private  entities  primarily \\nengaged  in  the  business  of  transporting  peo-\\nple which provide demand responsive service. \\nFor purposes of this section, other transpor-\\ntation services that involve calling for a car \\nand  a  driver  to  take  one  places  (e.g.,  lim-\\nousine services, of the kind that provide lux-\\nury cars and chauffeurs for senior proms and \\nanalogous adult events) are regarded  as taxi \\nservices. \\n\\nUnder  the  ADA,  no  private  entity  is  re-\\nquired to purchase an accessible automobile. \\nIf a taxi company purchases a larger vehicle, \\n\\n488 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00498 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cOffice of the Secretary of Transportation \\n\\nPt. 37, App. D \\n\\nlike a van, it is subject to the same rules as \\nany  other  private  entity  primarily  engaged \\nin  the  business  of  transporting  people  which \\noperates  a  demand  responsive  service.  That \\nis,  unless  it  is  already  providing  equivalent \\nservice,  any  van  it  acquires  must  be  acces-\\nsible. Equivalent service is measured accord-\\ning to the criteria of § 37.105. Taxi companies \\nare  not  required  to  acquire  vehicles  other \\nthan  automobiles  to  add  accessible  vehicles \\nto their fleets. \\n\\nTaxi  companies  are  subject  to  non-\\ndiscrimination  obligations.  These  obliga-\\ntions mean, first, that a taxi service may not \\ndeny a ride to an individual with a disability \\nwho  is  capable  of  using  the  taxi  vehicles.  It \\nwould  be  discrimination  to  pass  up  a  pas-\\nsenger because he or she was blind or used a \\nwheelchair,  if  the  wheelchair  was  one  that \\ncould be stowed in the cab and the passenger \\ncould  transfer  to  a  vehicle  seat.  Nor  could  a \\ntaxi  company  insist  that  a  wheelchair  user \\nwait  for  a  lift-equipped  van  if  the  person \\ncould use an automobile. \\n\\nIt  would  be  discrimination  for  a  driver  to \\nrefuse to assist with stowing a wheelchair in \\nthe trunk (since taxi drivers routinely assist \\npassengers  with  stowing  luggage).  It  would \\nbe  discrimination  to  charge  a  higher  fee  or \\nfare  for  carrying  a  person  with  a  disability \\nthan  for  carrying  a  non-disabled  passenger, \\nor a higher fee for stowing a wheelchair than \\nfor  stowing  a  suitcase.  (Charging  the  same \\nfee for stowing a wheelchair as for stowing a \\nsuitcase would be proper, however.) The fact \\nthat  it  may  take  somewhat  more  time  and \\neffort  to  serve  a  person  with  a  disability \\nthan  another  passenger  does  not  justify  dis-\\ncriminatory  conduct  with  respect  to  pas-\\nsengers with disabilities. \\n\\nState  or  local  governments  may  run  user- \\nside  subsidy  arrangements  for  the  general \\npublic  (e.g.,  taxi  voucher  systems  for  senior \\ncitizens  or  low-income  persons).  Under  the \\nDOJ title II rule, these programs would have \\nto  meet  ‘‘program  accessibility’’  require-\\nments,  which  probably  would  require  that \\naccessible  transportation  be  made  available \\nto senior citizens or low-income persons with \\ndisabilities.  This  would  not  directly  require \\nprivate taxi providers who accept the vouch-\\ners  to  purchase  accessible  vehicles  beyond \\nthe requirements of this rule, however. \\n\\nSection 37.31 Vanpools \\n\\nThis  provision  applies  to  public  vanpool \\nsystems the requirements for public entities \\noperating demand responsive systems for the \\ngeneral  public.  A  public  vanpool  system  is \\none  operated  by  a  public  entity,  or  in  which \\na  public  entity  owns  or  purchases  or  leases \\nthe  vehicles.  Lesser  degrees  of  public  in-\\nvolvement  with  an  otherwise  private  ride-\\nsharing arrangement (e.g., provision of park-\\ning spaces, HOV lanes, coordination or clear-\\ninghouse  services)  do  not  convert  a  private \\ninto a public system. \\n\\nThe  requirement  for  a  public  vanpool  sys-\\ntem is that it purchase or lease an accessible \\nvehicle  unless  it  can  demonstrate  that  it \\nprovides  equivalent  service  to  individuals \\nwith  disabilities,  including  individuals  who \\nuse wheelchairs, as it provides to individuals \\nwithout  disabilities.  For  a  public  vanpool \\nsystem,  the  equivalency  requirement  would \\nbe met if an accessible vehicle is made avail-\\nable  to  and  used  by  a  vanpool  when  an  indi-\\nvidual with a disability needs such a vehicle \\nto  participate.  Public  vanpool  systems  may \\nmeet  this  requirement  through  obtaining  a \\npercentage of accessible vehicles that is rea-\\nsonable  in  light  of  demand  for  them  by  par-\\nticipants, but this is not required, so long as \\nthe  entity  can  respond  promptly  to  requests \\nfor participation in a vanpool with the provi-\\nsion of an accessible van when needed. \\n\\nThere  is  no  requirement  for  private  van-\\npools, defined as a voluntary arrangement in \\nwhich the driver is compensated only for ex-\\npenses. \\n\\nSection 37.33 Airport Transportation Systems \\n\\nFixed  route  transportation  systems  oper-\\nated  by  public  airports  are  regarded  by  this \\nsection  as  fixed  route  commuter  bus  sys-\\ntems. As such, shuttles among terminals and \\nparking  lots,  connector  systems  among  the \\nairport  and  a  limited  number  of  other  local \\ndestinations  must  acquire  accessible  buses, \\nbut  are  not  subject  to  complementary  para-\\ntransit requirements. (If a public airport op-\\nerates  a  demand  responsive  system  for  the \\ngeneral  public,  it  would  be  subject  to  the \\nrules  for  demand  responsive  systems  for  the \\ngeneral public.) \\n\\nIt should be noted that this section applies \\nonly  to  transportation  services  that  are  op-\\nerated  by  public  airports  themselves  (or  by \\nprivate  contractors  who  stand  in  their \\nshoes).  When  a  regular  urban  mass  transit \\nsystem serves the airport, the airport is sim-\\nply  one  portion  of  its  service  area,  treated \\nfor  purposes  of  this  rule  like  the  rest  of  its \\nservice area. \\n\\nVirtually  all  airports  are  served  by  taxi \\ncompanies,  who  are  subject  to  § 37.29  at  air-\\nports  as  elsewhere.  In  addition,  many  air-\\nports  are  served  by  jitney  or  shuttle  sys-\\ntems.  Typically,  these  systems  operate  in  a \\nroute-deviation  or  similar  variable  mode  in \\nwhich there are passenger-initiated decisions \\nconcerning  destinations.  We  view  such  sys-\\ntems  as  demand  responsive  transportation \\noperated  by  private  entities  primarily  en-\\ngaged in the business of transporting people. \\nSince  many  of  these  operators  are  small \\nbusinesses,  it  may  be  difficult  for  them  to \\nmeet equivalency requirements on their own \\nwithout  eventually  having  all  or  nearly  all \\naccessible  vehicles,  which  could  pose  eco-\\nnomic  problems.  One  suggested  solution  to \\nthis  problem  is  for  the  operators  serving  a \\ngiven  airport  to  form  a  pool  or  consortium \\narrangement,  in  which  a  number  of  shared \\n\\n489 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00499 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cPt. 37, App. D \\n\\n49 CFR Subtitle A (10–1–21 Edition) \\n\\naccessible vehicles would meet the transpor-\\ntations of individuals with disabilities. As in \\nother  forms  of  transportation,  such  an  ar-\\nrangement  would  have  to  provide  service  in \\na  nondiscriminatory  way  (e.g.,  in  an  inte-\\ngrated setting, no higher fares for accessible \\nservice). \\n\\nSection 37.35 Supplemental Service for Other \\nTransportation Modes \\n\\nThis  section  applies  to  a  number  of  situa-\\ntions in which an operator of  another trans-\\nportation  mode  uses  bus  or  other  service  to \\nconnect its service with limited other points. \\nOne  instance  is  when  an  intercity  railroad \\nroute is set up such that the train stops out-\\nside the major urban center which is the ac-\\ntual destination for many passengers. Exam-\\nples mentioned to us include bus service run \\nby  Amtrak  from  a  stop  in  Columbus,  Wis-\\nconsin,  to  downtown  Madison,  or  from  San \\nJose  to  San  Francisco.  Such  service  is  fixed \\nroute, from the train station to a few points \\nin  the  metropolitan  area,  with  a  schedule \\nkeyed  to  the  train  schedule.  It  would  be  re-\\ngarded  as  commuter  bus  service,  meaning \\nthat accessible vehicles would have to be ac-\\nquired  but  complementary  paratransit  was \\nnot required. \\n\\nAnother  instance  is  one  in  which  a  com-\\nmuter rail operator uses fixed route bus serv-\\nice  as  a  dedicated  connection  to,  or  exten-\\nsion  of,  its  rail  service.  The  service  may  go \\nto  park  and  ride  lots  or  other  destinations \\nbeyond  the  vicinity  of  the  rail  line.  Again, \\nthis  service  shares  the  characteristics  of \\ncommuter  bus  service  that  might  be  used \\neven  if  the  rail  line  were  not  present,  and \\ndoes  not  attempt  to  be  a  comprehensive \\nmass transit bus service for the area. \\n\\nOf course, there may be instances in which \\na  rail  operator  uses  demand  responsive  in-\\nstead  of  fixed  route  service  for  a  purpose  of \\nthis  kind.  In  that  case,  the  demand  respon-\\nsive  system  requirements  of  the  rule  would \\napply. \\n\\nPrivate  entities \\n\\n(i.e.,  those  operating \\nplaces  of  public  accommodation)  may  oper-\\nate  similar  systems,  as  when  a  cruise  ship \\noperator  provides  a  shuttle  or  connector  be-\\ntween  an  airport  and  the  dock.  This  service \\nis covered by the rules governing private en-\\ntities  not  primarily  engaged  in  the  business \\nof  transporting  people.  Fixed  route  or  de-\\nmand  responsive  rules  apply,  depending  on \\nthe characteristics of the system involved. \\n\\nOne situation not explicitly covered in this \\nsection  concerns  ad  hoc  transportation  ar-\\nranged, for instance, by a rail operator when \\nthe  train  does  not  wind  up  at  its  intended \\ndestination.  For  example,  an  Amtrak  train \\nbound for Philadelphia may be halted at Wil-\\nmington  by  a  track  blockage  between  the \\ntwo  cities.  Usually,  the  carrier  responds  by \\nproviding  bus  service  to  the  scheduled  des-\\ntination or to the next point where rail serv-\\nice can resume. \\n\\nThe  service  that  the  carrier  provides  in \\nthis  situation  is  essentially  a  continuation \\nby  other  means  of  its  primary  service.  We \\nview  the  obligation  of  the  rail  operator  as \\nbeing  to  ensure  that  all  passengers,  includ-\\ning  individuals  with  disabilities,  are  pro-\\nvided  service  to  the  destination  in  a  non-\\ndiscriminatory manner. This includes, for in-\\nstance,  providing  service  in  the  most  inte-\\ngrated  setting  appropriate  to  the  needs  of \\nthe  individual  and  service  that  gets  a  pas-\\nsenger with a disability to the destination as \\nsoon as other passengers. \\n\\nSection 37.37 Other Applications \\n\\nThe  ADA  specifically  defines  ‘‘public  enti-\\nty.’’ Anything else is a ‘‘private entity.’’ The \\nstatute  does  not  include  in  this  definition  a \\nprivate  entity  that  receives  a  subsidy  or \\nfranchise  from  a  state  or  local  government \\nor  is  regulated  by  a  public  entity.  Only \\nthrough the definition of ‘‘operates’’ (see dis-\\ncussion  of  § 37.23)  do  private  entities’  rela-\\ntionships  to  public  entities  subject  private \\nentities  to  the  requirements  for  public  enti-\\nties.  Consequently,  in  deciding  which  provi-\\nsions  of  the  rule  to  apply  to  an  entity  in \\nother  than  situations  covered  by  § 37.23,  the \\nnature  of  the  entity—public  or  private—is \\ndeterminative. \\n\\nTransportation  service  provided  by  public \\naccommodations is viewed as being provided \\nby  private  entities  not  primarily  engaged  in \\nthe  business  of  transporting  people.  Either \\nthe  provisions  of  this  part  applicable  to  de-\\nmand  responsive  or  fixed  route  systems \\napply,  depending  on  the  nature  of  a  specific \\nsystem at a specific location. The distinction \\nbetween  fixed  route  and  demand  responsive \\nsystems  is  discussed  in  connection  with  the \\ndefinitions  section  above.  It  is  the  responsi-\\nbility  of  each  private  entity,  in  the  first  in-\\nstance, to assess the nature of each transpor-\\ntation system on a case-by-case basis and de-\\ntermine the applicable rules. \\n\\nOn  the  other  hand,  conveyances  used  for \\nrecreational  purposes,  such  as  amusement \\npark  rides,  ski  lifts,  or  historic  rail  cars  or \\ntrolleys  operated  in  museum  settings,  are \\nnot viewed as transportation under this rule \\nat  all.  Other  conveyances  may  fit  into  this \\ncategory as well. \\n\\nThe  criterion  for  determining  what  re-\\nquirements  apply  is  whether  the  convey-\\nances  are  primarily  an  aspect  of  the  rec-\\nreational experience itself or a means of get-\\nting  from  Point  A  to  Point  B.  At  a  theme \\npark,  for  instance,  a  large  roller  coaster \\n(though  a  ‘‘train’’  of  cars  on  a  track)  is  a \\npublic  accommodation  not  subject  to  this \\nrule;  the  tram  that  transports  the  paying \\ncustomers  around  the  park,  with  a  stop  at \\nthe roller coaster, is a transportation system \\nsubject  to  the  ‘‘private,  not  primarily’’  pro-\\nvisions of this part. \\n\\nEmployer-provided  transportation  for  em-\\nployees  is  not  covered  by  this  part,  but  by \\n\\n490 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00500 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cOffice of the Secretary of Transportation \\n\\nPt. 37, App. D \\n\\nEEOC rules under title I of the ADA. (Public \\nentities  are  also  subject  to  DOJ’s  title  II \\nrules  with  respect  to  employment.)  This  ex-\\nclusion  from  part  37  applies  to  transpor-\\ntation  services  provided  by  an  employer \\n(whether  access  to  motor  pool  vehicles, \\nparking  shuttles,  employer-sponsored  van \\npools)  that  is  made  available  solely  to  its \\nown employees. If an employer provides serv-\\nice  to  its  own  employees  and  other  persons, \\nsuch  as  workers  of  other  employers  or  cus-\\ntomers,  it  would  be  subject  to  the  require-\\nments  of  this  part  from  private  entities  not \\nprimarily  engaged  in  the  business  of  trans-\\nporting  people  or  public  entities,  as  applica-\\nble. \\n\\nThe  rule  looks  to  the  private  entity  actu-\\nally  providing  the  transportation  service  in \\nquestion  in  determining  whether  the  ‘‘pri-\\nvate,  primarily’’  or ‘‘private,  not primarily’’ \\nrules  apply.  For  example,  Conglomerate, \\nInc.,  owns  a  variety  of  agribusiness,  petro-\\nchemical,  weapons  system  production,  and \\nfast  food  corporations.  One  of  its  many  sub-\\nsidiaries, Green Tours, Inc., provides charter \\nbus  service  for  people  who  want  to  view  na-\\ntional  parks,  old-growth  forests,  and  other \\nenvironmentally  significant  places.  It  is \\nprobably  impossible  to  say  in  what  business \\nConglomerate, Inc. is primarily engaged, but \\nit  clearly  is  not  transporting  people.  Green \\nTours, Inc., on the other hand, is clearly pri-\\nmarily  engaged  in  the  business  of  trans-\\nporting people, and the rule treats it as such. \\nOn the other hand, when operating a trans-\\nportation  service  off  to  the  side  of  to  the \\nmain  business  of  a  public  accommodation \\n(e.g.,  a  hotel  shuttle),  the  entity  as  a  whole \\nwould  be  considered.  Even  if  some  dedicated \\nemployees  are  used  to  provide  the  service, \\nshuttles  and  other  systems  provided  as  a \\nmeans of getting to, from, or around a public \\naccommodation  remain  solidly  in  the  ‘‘pri-\\nvate, not primarily’’ category. \\n\\nSUBPART C—TRANSPORTATION FACILITIES \\n\\nSection 37.41 Construction of Transportation \\nFacilities by Public Entities \\n\\nSection  37.41  contains  the  general  require-\\nment  that  all  new  facilities  constructed \\nafter  January  25,  1992,  be  accessible  to  and \\nusable  by  individuals  with  disabilities.  This \\nprovision  tracks  the  statute  closely,  and  is \\nanalogous  to  a  provision  in  the  DOJ  regula-\\ntions  for  private  entities.  Section  226  of  the \\nADA  provides  little  discretion  in  this  re-\\nquirement. \\n\\nThe  requirement  is  keyed  to  construction \\nwhich  ‘‘begins’’  after  January  25,  1992.  The \\nregulation  defines  ‘‘begin’’  to  mean  when  a \\nnotice to proceed order has been issued. This \\nterm  has  a  standard  meaning  in  the  con-\\nstruction  industry,  as  an  instruction  to  the \\ncontractor to proceed with the work. \\n\\nQuestions  have  been  raised  concerning \\nwhich  standards  apply  before  January  26, \\n\\n1992.  There  are  Federal  requirements  that \\napply  to  all  recipients  of  federal  money,  de-\\npending on the circumstances. \\n\\nFirst,  if  an  entity  is  a  Federal  recipient \\nand uses Federal dollars to construct the fa-\\ncility,  regulations  implementing  section  504 \\nof  the  Rehabilitation  Act  of  1973  (29  U.S.C. \\n794), require the recipient to comply with the \\nUniform Federal Accessibility Standards. \\n\\nSecond, since the Civil Rights Restoration \\nAct  of  1987  (Pub.  L.  100–259),  an  operation  of \\na  recipient  of  federal  funds  would  also  have \\nto  comply  with  section  504,  even  though  the \\nactivity was not paid for with Federal funds. \\nThus,  the  Uniform  Federal  Accessibility \\nStandards  would  apply  to  this  construction \\nas well. \\n\\nAs  mentioned  above,  the  Department  in-\\ntends,  in  the  period  before  January  26,  1991, \\nto  view  compliance  with  section  504  in  light \\nof  compliance  with  ADA  requirements  (this \\npoint  applies  to  alterations  as  well  as  new \\nconstruction). Consequently, in reviewing re-\\nquests for grants, contract approvals, exemp-\\ntions, etc., (whether with respect to ongoing \\nprojects  or  new,  experimental,  or  one-time \\nefforts),  the  Department  will,  as  a  policy \\nmatter, seek to ensure compliance with ADA \\nstandards. \\n\\nSection 37.42 \\n\\nService  in  an  integrated  setting  to  pas-\\nsengers  at  intercity,  commuter,  and  high- \\nspeed  rail  station  platforms  constructed  or \\naltered after February 1, 2012. \\n\\nIndividuals  with  disabilities,  including  in-\\ndividuals who use wheelchairs, must have ac-\\ncess to all accessible cars in each train using \\na  new  or  altered  station.  This  performance \\nstandard  will  apply  at  stations  where  con-\\nstruction  or  alteration  of  platforms  begins \\n135  days  or  more  after  the  rule  is  published. \\nThe  performance  standard  does  not  require \\nrail  operators  to  retrofit  existing  station \\nplatforms  or  cars.  The  requirement  is  pro-\\nspective,  and  section  37.42  does  not  require \\nretrofit  of  existing  stations  (though  compli-\\nance  with  existing  disability  nondiscrimina-\\ntion  requirements  not  being  altered  is  still \\nrequired).  To  meet  this  performance  stand-\\nard  on  lines  or  systems  where  track  passing \\nthrough  stations  and  adjacent  to  platforms \\nis  shared  with  existing  freight  rail  oper-\\nations,  passenger  railroads  that  do  not \\nchoose  to  provide  level-entry  boarding  may, \\nafter  obtaining  FRA  and/or  FTA  approval, \\nuse  car-borne  lifts,  ramps  or  other  devices, \\nmini-high  platforms  (making  multiple  stops \\nwhere necessary to accommodate passengers \\nwishing to use different cars of the train), or \\nmovable station-based lifts. \\n\\nOn commuter, intercity, or high-speed rail \\nlines  or  systems  in  which  track  passing \\nthrough  stations  and  adjacent  to  platforms \\nis not shared with existing freight rail oper-\\nations,  the  performance  standard  must  be \\nmet  by  providing  level-entry  boarding  to  all \\n\\n491 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00501 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cPt. 37, App. D \\n\\n49 CFR Subtitle A (10–1–21 Edition) \\n\\naccessible cars in each train that serves new \\nor altered stations on the line or system. For \\nexample,  if  a  new  commuter  or  high-speed \\nrail  line  or  system  is  being  built,  and  the \\ntrack  adjacent  to  platforms  is  not  shared \\nwith  freight  traffic  (e.g.,  it  is  a  passenger \\nrail-only  system,  or  a  passing  or  gauntlet \\ntrack exists for freight traffic), then the sta-\\ntions  would  have  to  provide  level-entry \\nboarding.  Other  options  would  not  be  per-\\nmitted. \\n\\nIf  a  platform  being  constructed  or  altered \\nis not adjacent to track used for freight, but \\nthe  track  and  platform  are  used  by  more \\nthan  one  passenger  railroad  (e.g.,  Amtrak \\nand  a  commuter  railroad),  the  possibility  of \\nthe platform serving cars with different door \\nheights  exists.  In  this  situation,  the  level- \\nentry  boarding  requirement  continues  to \\nexist. Generally, the platform should be level \\nwith  respect  to  the  system  that  has  the \\nlower  boarding  height.  This  is  because  it  is \\nnot good safety practice to make passengers \\nstep down (or be lifted down or use ramps to \\nget  down)  to  board  a  train.  For  example,  if \\nAmtrak operates through a station with cars \\nthat are 15 inches ATR, and a commuter rail-\\nroad  uses  the  same  platform  with  cars  that \\nare  25  inches  ATR,  the  platform  would  be \\nlevel  with  respect  to  the  Amtrak  cars.  The \\ncommuter railroad would have to provide an-\\nother  means  of  access,  such  as  lifts.  In  all \\nsuch  cases  where  mixed  rail  equipment  will \\nbe used, the rule requires that both FRA and \\nFTA  be  consulted  by  the  railroads  involved. \\nAs in other cases where level-entry boarding \\nis  not  used,  the  railroad  must  obtain  FTA \\nand/or  FRA  approval  for  the  means  the  rail-\\nroad  wants  to  use  to  meet  the  performance \\nstandard. \\n\\nThe  details  of  the  ‘‘track  passing  through \\nstations  and  adjacent  to  platforms  is  shared \\nwith  existing  freight  rail  operations’’  lan-\\nguage  are  important.  There  may  be  stations \\nthat  serve  lines  that  are  shared,  at  some \\npoints,  by  passenger  and  freight  traffic,  but \\nwhere the freight traffic does not go through \\nthe  particular  station  (e.g.,  because  freight \\ntraffic  bypasses  the  station),  level-entry \\nboarding is required. There could also be sit-\\nuations  on  which  multiple  tracks  pass \\nthrough  a  station,  and  freight  traffic  uses \\nonly a center track, not a track which is ad-\\njacent  to  a  platform.  In  such  cases,  the  new \\nor  altered  platform  would  have  to  provide \\nlevel-entry boarding. It is important to note \\nthat  this  language  refers  to \\n‘‘existing’’ \\nfreight  rail  traffic,  as  opposed  to  the  possi-\\nbility  that  freight  traffic  might  use  the \\ntrack in question at some future time. Like-\\nwise,  if  freight  trains  have  not  used  a  track \\npassing through a station in a significant pe-\\nriod  of  time (e.g.,  the past  10 years), the De-\\npartment  does  not  view  this  as  constituting \\n‘‘existing freight rail traffic.’’ \\n\\nPassenger  rail  operators  must  provide  ac-\\ncess  only  to  accessible,  available  cars  that \\n\\npeople  with  disabilities  are  trying  to  access \\nat a given station. If a train has eight acces-\\nsible  cars,  and  wheelchair  users  want  to \\nenter only cars 2 and 7 (see discussion below \\nof passenger notification), then railroad per-\\nsonnel  need  to  deploy  lifts  or  bridge  plates \\nonly  at  cars  2  and  7,  not  at  the  other  cars. \\nSimilarly, the rule requires operators to pro-\\nvide  access  only  to  available  cars  at  a  sta-\\ntion. If a train has eight accessible cars, but \\nthe  platform  only  serves  cars  1  through  6, \\nthen  railroad  personnel  need  to  deploy  lifts \\nor bridge plates only at cars that people with \\ndisabilities are trying to access and that are \\navailable  to  all  passengers.  We  would  also \\npoint  out  that  wheelchair  positions  on  rail \\npassenger  cars  are  intended  to  serve  wheel-\\nchair  users,  and  railroad  operators  should \\ntake  steps  to  ensure  that  these  spaces  are \\navailable  for  wheelchair  users  and  not  for \\nother  uses.  For  example,  it  would  be  con-\\ntrary to the rule for a wheelchair user to be \\ntold  that  he  or  she  could  not  use  car  7  be-\\ncause  the  wheelchair  spaces  were  filled  with \\nother  passengers’  luggage  from  a  previous \\nstop. \\n\\nIn  order  to  ensure  that  access  was  pro-\\nvided,  passengers  would  have  to  notify  rail-\\nroad  personnel.  For  example,  if  a  passenger \\nat  a  station  wanted  to  use  a  station-based \\nlift  to  access  car  6,  the  passenger  would  re-\\nquest the use of car 6 and railroad personnel \\nwould  deploy  the  lift  at  that  car.  Likewise, \\nat  a  station  using  a  mini-high  platform,  a \\npassenger  on  this  platform  would  inform \\ntrain  personnel  that  he  or  she  wanted  to \\nenter  car  5,  whereupon  the  train  would  pull \\nforward so that car 5 was opposite the mini- \\nhigh platform. We contemplate that these re-\\nquests would be made when the train arrives, \\nand railroads could not insist on advance no-\\ntice  (e.g.,  the  railroad  could  not  require  a \\npassenger  to  call  a  certain  time  in  advance \\nto  make  a  ‘‘reservation’’  to  use  a  lift  to  get \\non  a  particular  car).  As  part  of  its  submis-\\nsion  to  FTA  or  FRA,  the  railroad  would  de-\\nscribe  the  procedure  it  would  use  to  receive \\nand fulfill these requests. \\n\\nWhere  a  railroad  operator  wishes  to  pro-\\nvide  access  to  its  rail  cars  through  a  means \\nother  than  level-entry  boarding,  it  is  essen-\\ntial that it provide an integrated, safe, time-\\nly, reliable, and effective means of access for \\npeople with disabilities. A railroad is not re-\\nquired  to  choose  what  might  be  regarded  as \\na  more  desirable  or  convenient  method  over \\na  less  desirable  or  convenient  method,  or  to \\nchoose a more costly option over a less cost-\\nly  option.

The  railroad  must  submit \\nthis  comparison  to  FTA  and  FRA  at  the \\nsame time as it submits its plan to FRA and/ \\nor  FTA,  as  described  below,  although  the \\ncomparison is not part of the basis on which \\nthe  agencies  would  determine  whether  the \\nplan  meets  the  performance  standard.  The \\nDepartment  believes  that,  in  creating  this \\nplan,  railroads  should  consult  with  inter-\\nested  individuals  and  groups  and  should \\nmake  the  plan  readily  available  to  the  pub-\\nlic, including individuals with disabilities. \\n\\nTo ensure that the railroad’s chosen option \\nworks,  the  railroad  must  provide  to  FRA  or \\nFTA (or both), as applicable, a plan explain-\\ning how its preferred method will provide the \\nrequired  integrated,  safe,  reliable,  timely \\nand effective means of access for people with \\ndisabilities.  The  plan  would  have  to  explain \\nhow  boarding  equipment  (e.g.,  bridge  plates, \\nlifts,  ramps,  or  other  appropriate  devices) \\nand/or  platforms  will  be  deployed,  main-\\ntained,  and  operated,  as  well  as  how  per-\\nsonnel will be trained and deployed to ensure \\nthat  service  to  individuals  with  disabilities \\nwas  provided  in  an  integrated,  safe,  timely, \\neffective, and reliable manner. \\n\\nFTA  and/or  FRA  will  evaluate  the  pro-\\nposed  plan  with  respect  to  whether  it  will \\nachieve  the  objectives  of  the  performance \\nstandard  and  may  approve,  disapprove,  or \\nmodify  it.  It  should  be  emphasized  that  the \\npurpose of FTA/FRA review of this plan is to \\nmake sure that whatever approach a railroad \\nchooses  will  in  fact  work;  that  is,  it  will \\nreally  result  in  an  integrated,  safe,  reliable, \\ntimely and effective means of access for peo-\\nple with disabilities. If a plan, in the view of \\nFRA  or  FTA,  fails  to  meet  this  test,  then \\nFTA or FRA can reject it or require the rail-\\nroad  to  modify  it  to  meet  the  objectives  of \\nthis provision. \\n\\nIn  considering  railroads’  plans,  the  agen-\\ncies  will  consider  factors  including,  but  not \\nlimited to, how the proposal maximizes inte-\\ngration  of  and  accessibility  to  individuals \\nwith disabilities, any obstacles to the use of \\na method that could provide better service to \\nindividuals  with  disabilities,  the  safety  and \\nreliability  of  the  approach  and  related  tech-\\nnology proposed to be used, the suitability of \\nthe  means  proposed  to  the  station  and  line \\nand/or system on which it would be used, and \\nthe adequacy of equipment and maintenance \\nand staff training and deployment. \\n\\nFor  example,  some  commenters  have  ex-\\npressed significant concerns about the use of \\nstation-based lifts, noting instances in which \\nsuch lifts have not been maintained in a safe \\nand  reliable  working  order.  A  railroad  pro-\\nposing  to  use  station-based  lifts  would  have \\n\\nto describe to FTA or FRA how it would en-\\nsure that the lifts remained in safe and reli-\\nable  operating  condition  (such  as  by  cycling \\nthe  lift  daily  or  other  regular  maintenance) \\nand  how  it  would  ensure  that  personnel  to \\noperate  the  lift  were  available  in  a  timely \\nmanner  to  assist  passengers  in  boarding  a \\ntrain. This demonstration must clearly state \\nhow  the  railroad  expects  that  their  oper-\\nations will provide safe and dignified service \\nto the users of such lifts. \\n\\nIn  existing  stations  where  it  is  possible  to \\nprovide  access  to  every  car  without  station \\nor  rail  car  retrofits,  rail  providers  that  re-\\nceive  DOT  financial  assistance  should  be \\nmindful  of  the  requirement  of  49  CFR \\n27.7(b)(2), which requires that service be pro-\\nvided ‘‘in the most integrated setting that is \\nreasonably achievable.’’ For example, if a set \\nof  rail  cars  has  car-borne  lifts  that  enable \\nthe  railroad  to  comply  with  section  37.42  at \\nnew or altered station platforms, it is likely \\nthat  deployment  of  this  lift  at  existing  sta-\\ntions  will  be  reasonably  achievable.  Simi-\\nlarly,  it  is  likely  that,  in  a  system  using \\nmini-high  platforms,  making  multiple  stops \\nat  existing  stations  would  be  reasonable \\nachievable. The use of a station-based lift at \\nan  existing  station  to  serve  more  than  one \\ncar  of  a  train  may  well  also  be  reasonably \\nachievable (e.g., with movement of the lift or \\nmultiple  stops,  as  needed).  Such  actions \\nwould  serve  the  objective  of  providing  serv-\\nice  in  an  integrated  setting.  In  addition,  in \\nsituations  where  a  railroad  and  the  Depart-\\nment  have  negotiated  access  to  every  acces-\\nsible  car  in  an  existing  system  (e.g.,  with \\ncar-borne  lifts  and  mini-high  platforms  as  a \\nback-up),  the  Department  expects  the  rail-\\nroads  to  continue  to  provide  access  to  every \\naccessible car for people with disabilities. \\n\\nSection  37.42(e)  provides  a  safety  require-\\nment  concerning  the  setback  of  structures \\nand  obstacles  (e.g.,  mini-high  platforms,  ele-\\nvators,  escalators,  and  stairwells)  from  the \\nplatform  edge.  This  provision  is  based  on \\nlong-standing  FRA  recommendations  and \\nthe  expertise  of  the  Department’s  staff.  The \\nDepartment  believes  that  it  is  inadvisable, \\nwith the exception of boarding and alighting \\na  train,  to  ever  have  a  wheelchair  operate \\nover the two-foot wide tactile strips that are \\nparallel  to  the  edge  of  the  platform.  This \\nleaves  a  four-foot  distance  for  a  person  in  a \\ntypical  wheelchair  to  maneuver  safely  past \\nstair wells, elevator shafts, etc. It also is im-\\nportant  because  a  wheelchair  user  exiting  a \\ntrain  at  a  door  where  there  is  not  a  six-foot \\nclearance  would \\nlikely  have  difficulty \\nexiting  and  making  the  turn  out  of  the  rail \\ncar  door.  The  requirement  would  also  avoid \\nchanneling  pedestrians  through  a  relatively \\nnarrow  space  where,  in  crowded  platform \\nconditions,  there  would  be  an  increased \\nchance of someone falling off the edge of the \\nplatform.  Since  the  rule  concerns  only  new \\nand  altered  platforms,  the  Department  does \\n\\n493 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00503 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cPt. 37, App. D \\n\\n49 CFR Subtitle A (10–1–21 Edition) \\n\\nnot believe the cost or difficulty of designing \\nthe  platforms  to  eliminate  this  hazard  will \\nbe significant. \\n\\nSection 37.42(f) provides the maximum gap \\nallowable  for  a  platform  to  be  considered \\n‘‘level.’’  However,  this  maximum  is  not  in-\\ntended  to  be  the  norm  for  new  or  altered \\nplatforms. The Department expects transpor-\\ntation  providers  to  minimize  platform  gaps \\nto  the  greatest  extent  possible  by  building \\nstations on tangent track and using gap-fill-\\ning  technologies,  such  as  moveable  platform \\nedges, threshold plates, platform end boards, \\nand  flexible  rubber  fingers  on  the  ends  of \\nplatforms.  The  Department  encourages  the \\nuse  of  Gap  Management  Plans  and  consulta-\\ntion  with  FRA  and/or  FTA  for  guidance  on \\ngap safety issues. \\n\\nEven  where  level-entry  boarding  is  pro-\\nvided,  it  is  likely  that,  in  many  instances, \\nbridge plates would have to be used to enable \\npassengers with disabilities to enter cars, be-\\ncause  of  the  horizontal  gaps  involved.  Sec-\\ntion  38.95(c)(5),  referred  to  in  the  regulatory \\ntext,  permits  various  ramp  slopes  for  bridge \\nplates,  depending  on  the  vertical  gap  in \\ngiven situation. In order to maximize the op-\\nportunity  of  passengers  to  board  independ-\\nently, the Department urges railroads to use \\nthe least steep ramp slope feasible at a given \\nplatform. \\n\\nSection 37.43 Alteration of Transportation \\nFacilities by Public Entities \\n\\nThis  section  sets  out  the  accessibility  re-\\nquirements  that  apply  when  a  public  entity \\nundertakes an alteration of an existing facil-\\nity. In general, the section requires that any \\nalteration,  to  the  maximum  extent  feasible, \\nresults in the altered area being accessible to \\nand  usable  by  individuals  with  disabilities, \\nincluding  persons  who  use  wheelchairs.  The \\nprovisions  follow  closely  those  adopted  by \\nthe  DOJ,  in  its  regulations  implementing \\ntitle III of the ADA. \\n\\nThe  section  requires  specific  activities \\nwhenever  an  alteration  of  an  existing  facil-\\nity is undertaken. \\n\\nFirst,  if  the  alteration  is  made  to  a  pri-\\nmary  function  area,  (or  access  to  an  area \\ncontaining  a  primary  function),  the  entity \\nshall make the alteration in such a way as to \\nensure that the path of travel to the altered \\narea  and  the  restrooms,  telephones  and \\ndrinking fountains servicing the altered area \\nare  readily  accessible  to  and  usable  by  indi-\\nviduals  with  disabilities,  including  individ-\\nuals who use wheelchairs. \\n\\nSecond,  alterations  to  drinking  fountains, \\ntelephones,  and  restrooms  do  not  have  to  be \\ncompleted  if  the  cost  and  scope  of  making \\nthem accessible is disproportionate. \\n\\nThird, the requirement goes into effect for \\n\\nalterations begun after January 25, 1992. \\n\\nFourth,  the  term  ‘‘maximum  extent  fea-\\nsible’’  means  that  all  changes  that  are  pos-\\nsible  must  be  made.  The  requirement  to \\n\\nmake  changes  to  the  maximum  extent  fea-\\nsible  derives  from  clear  legislative  history. \\nThe Senate Report states— \\n\\nThe  phrase  ‘‘to  the  maximum  extent  fea-\\nsible’’ has been included to allow for the oc-\\ncasional case in which the nature of an exist-\\ning  facility  is  such  as  to  make  it  virtually \\nimpossible  to  renovate  the  building  in  a \\nmanner that results in its being entirely ac-\\ncessible  to  and  usable  by  individuals  with \\ndisabilities.  In  all  such  cases,  however,  the \\nalteration  should  provide  the  maximum \\namount of physical accessibility feasible. \\n\\nThus,  for  example  the  term  ‘‘to  the  max-\\nimum  extent  feasible’’  should  be  construed \\nas not requiring entities to make building al-\\nterations that have little likelihood of being \\naccomplished without removing or altering a \\nload-bearing  structural  member  unless  the \\nload-bearing structural member is otherwise \\nbeing removed or altered as part of the alter-\\nation. (S. Rept. 101–116, at 68). \\n\\nFifth, primary function means a major ac-\\ntivity for which the facility is intended. Pri-\\nmary  function  areas  include  waiting  areas, \\nticket purchase and collection areas, train or \\nbus  platforms,  baggage  checking  and  return \\nareas, and employment areas (with some ex-\\nceptions stated in the rule, for areas used by \\nservice  personnel  that  are  very  difficult  to \\naccess). \\n\\nSixth,  ‘‘path  of  travel’’  means  a  contin-\\nuous,  unobstructed  way  of  pedestrian  pas-\\nsage by means of which the altered area may \\nbe  approached,  entered,  and  exited,  and \\nwhich  connects  the  altered  area  with  an  ex-\\nterior approach and includes restrooms, tele-\\nphones,  and  drinking  fountains  serving  the \\naltered area. If changes to the path of travel \\nthose \\nare  disproportionate, \\nchanges  which  are  not  disproportionate  are \\nto be completed. \\n\\nthen  only \\n\\nSeven,  the  final  rule  specifies  that  costs \\nexceeding  20  percent  would  be  dispropor-\\ntionate.  This  is  consistent  with  the  DOJ.  In \\ndetermining  costs,  the  Department  intends \\ncosts to be based on changes to the passenger \\nservice area that is scheduled for alteration. \\nFinally,  the  Department  has  defined  the \\nterm  ‘‘begin’’,  in  the  context  of  begin  an  al-\\nteration that is subject to the alteration pro-\\nvision  to  mean  when  a  notice  to  proceed  or \\nwork order is issued. Two terms are used (in-\\nstead  of  only  notice  to  proceed  in  the  con-\\ntext  of  new  construction)  because  many  al-\\nterations  may  be  carried  out  by  the  entity \\nitself,  in  which  case  the  only  triggering \\nevent  would  be  a  work  order  or  similar  au-\\nthorization to begin. \\n\\nIn \\n\\nlooking  at \\n\\nfacility  concepts \\n\\nlike \\n‘‘disproportionality’’  and  ‘‘to  the  maximum \\nextent  feasible,’’  the  Department  will  con-\\nsider  any  expenses  related  to  accessibility \\nfor passengers. It is not relevant to consider \\nnon-passenger  related  improvements  (e.g., \\ninstalling  a  new  track  bed)  or  to  permit \\n‘‘gold-plating’’  (attributing  to  accessibility \\n\\n494 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00504 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cOffice of the Secretary of Transportation \\n\\nPt. 37, App. D \\n\\ncosts  the  expense  of  non-related  improve-\\nments,  such  as  charging  to  accessibility \\ncosts  the  price  of  a  whole  new  door,  when \\nonly adding a new handle to the old door was \\nneeded for accessibility). \\n\\nSection 37.47 Key Stations in Light and Rapid \\nRail Systems \\n\\nSection  37.49 Designation  of  Responsible  Per-\\nson(s)  for  Intercity  and  Commuter  Rail  Sta-\\ntions \\n\\nThis section sets forth a mechanism for de-\\ntermining  who  bears  the  legal  and  financial \\nresponsibility for accessibility modifications \\nto  a  commuter  and/or  intercity  rail  station. \\nThe final provision of the section is the most \\nimportant.  It  authorizes  all  concerned  par-\\nties  to  come  to  their  own  agreement  con-\\ncerning  the  allocation  of  responsibility. \\nSuch  an  agreement  can  allocate  responsi-\\nbility  in  any  way  acceptable  to  the  parties. \\nThe Department strongly encourages parties \\nto come to such an agreement. \\n\\nIn  the  absence  of  such  an  agreement,  a \\nstatutory/regulatory  scheme  allocates  re-\\nsponsibility. In the first, and simplest, situa-\\ntion posed by the statute, a single public en-\\ntity  owns  more  than  50  percent  of  the  sta-\\ntion. In this case, the public entity is the re-\\nsponsible  person  and  nobody  else  is  required \\nto bear any of the responsibility. \\n\\nIn  the  second  situation,  a  private  entity \\nowns  more  than  50  percent  of  the  station. \\nThe  private  entity  need  not  bear  any  of  the \\nresponsibility  for  making  the  station  acces-\\nsible.  A  public  entity  owner  of  the  station, \\nwho  does  not  operate  passenger  railroad \\nservice  through  the  station,  is  not  required \\nto  bear  any  of  the  responsibility  for  making \\nthe  station  accessible.  The  total  responsi-\\nbility is divided between passenger railroads \\noperating service through the station, on the \\nbasis  of  respective  passenger  boardings.  If \\nthere  is  only  one  railroad  operating  service \\nthrough  the  station,  it  bears  the  total  re-\\nsponsibility. \\n\\nThe Department believes that reference to \\npassenger  boardings  is  the  most  equitable \\nway  of  dividing  responsibility  among  rail-\\nroads,  since  the  number  of  people  drawn  to \\nthe station by each is likely to reflect ‘‘cost \\ncausation’’  quite  closely.  The  Department \\nnotes,  however,  that,  as  passenger  boarding \\npercentages change over time, the portion of \\nresponsibility  assigned  to  each  party  also \\nmay  change.  Station  modifications  may  in-\\nvolve long-term capital investment and plan-\\nning,  while  passenger  boarding  percentages \\nare  more  volatile.  Some  railroads  may  stop \\nserving  a  station,  while  others  may  begin \\nservice,  during  the  period  of  time  before \\nmodifications  to  the  station  are  complete. \\nTo  help  accommodate  such  situations,  the \\nrule  refers  to  passenger  boardings  ‘‘over  the \\nentire  period  during  which  the  station  is \\nmade accessible.’’ \\n\\nThis  language  is  intended  to  emphasize \\nthat as circumstances change, the parties in-\\nvolved have the responsibility to adjust their \\narrangements for cost sharing. For example, \\nsuppose Railroad A has 30 percent of the pas-\\nsenger boardings in year 1, but by year 10 has \\n60  percent  of  the  boardings.  It  would  not  be \\nfair for Railroad A to pay only 30 percent of \\nthe  costs  of  station  modifications  occurring \\nin  later  years.  Ultimately,  the  total  cost \\nburden  for  modifying  the  station  over  (for \\nexample)  20  years  would  be  allocated  on  the \\nshare  of  the  total  number  or  boardings  at-\\ntributable to each railroad over the whole 20 \\nyear  period,  in  order  to  avoid  such  unfair-\\nness. \\n\\nThe third, and most complicated, situation \\nis  one  in  which  no  party  owns  50  percent  of \\nthe  station.  For  example,  consider  the  fol-\\nlowing hypothetical situation: \\n\\nParty \\n\\nOwnership \\npercentage \\n\\nBoardings \\npercentage \\n\\nPrivate freight RR ......................\\nCity ............................................\\nAmtrak .......................................\\nCommuter A ..............................\\nCommuter B ..............................\\n\\n40 \\n30 \\n0 \\n30 \\n0 \\n\\n0 \\n0 \\n25 \\n50 \\n25 \\n\\nThe private freight railroad drops out of the \\ncalculation  of  who  is  responsible.  All  of  the \\nresponsibility would be allocated among four \\npublic entities: the city (a public entity who \\ndoes  not  operate  railroad  service),  Amtrak, \\nand the two commuter railroads. Half the re-\\nsponsibility would go to public entity owners \\nof  the  station  (whether  or  not  they  are  rail-\\nroads who run passenger service through the \\nstation). The other half of the responsibility \\nwould  go  to  railroads  who  run  passenger \\nservice  through  the  station  (whether  or  not \\nthey are station owners). \\n\\nOn the ownership side of the equation, the \\ncity  and  Commuter  A  each  own  half  of  that \\nportion  of  the  station  that  is  not  owned  by \\nthe  private  freight  railroad.  Therefore,  the \\ntwo  parties  divide  up  the  ownership  half  of \\nthe  responsibility  equally.  Based  on  their \\nownership interest, each of these two parties \\nbears 25 percent of the responsibility for the \\nentire  station.  Note  that,  should  ownership \\npercentages  or  owners  change  over  the  pe-\\nriod  during  which  the  station  is  to  be  made \\naccessible, these percentages may change. It \\nis  ownership  percentage  over  this  entire  pe-\\nriod that ultimately determines the percent-\\nage of responsibility. \\n\\nOn the passenger rail operations side of the \\nequation,  50  percent  of  passenger  boardings \\nare  attributable  to  Commuter  A  and  25  per-\\ncent  each  to  Commuter  B  and  Amtrak. \\nTherefore, half of this portion of the respon-\\nsibility  belongs  to  Commuter  A,  while  a \\nquarter  share  each  goes  to  the  other  rail-\\nroads.  This  means  that,  based  on  passenger \\nboardings,  25  percent  of  the  responsibility \\n\\n495 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00505 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cPt. 37, App. D \\n\\n49 CFR Subtitle A (10–1–21 Edition) \\n\\ngoes  to  Commuter  A,  12.5  percent  to  Com-\\nmuter B, and 12.5 percent to Amtrak. Again, \\nit  is  the  proportion  of  passenger  boardings \\nover  the  entire  length  of  the  period  during \\nwhich the station is made accessible that ul-\\ntimately  determines  the  percentage  of  re-\\nsponsibility. \\n\\nIn  this  hypothetical,  Commuter  A  is  re-\\nsponsible  for  a  total  of  50  percent  of  the  re-\\nsponsibility  for  the  station.  Commuter  A  is \\nresponsible  for  25  percent  of  the  responsi-\\nbility  because  of  its  role  as  a  station  owner \\nand  another  25  percent  because  of  its  oper-\\nation  of  passenger  rail  service  through  the \\nstation. \\n\\nThe Department recognizes that there will \\nbe  situations  in  which  application  of  this \\nscheme will be difficult (e.g., involving prob-\\nlems with multiple owners of a station whose \\nownership  percentages  may  be  difficult  to \\nascertain).  The  Department  again  empha-\\nsizes  that  agreement  among  the  parties  is \\nthe best way of resolving these problems, but \\nwe  are  willing  to  work  with  the  parties  to \\nensure a solution consistent with this rule. \\n\\nSection 37.51 Key Stations in Commuter Rail \\nSystems \\n\\nThese sections require that key stations in \\nlight,  rapid,  and  commuter  rail  systems  be \\nmade  accessible  as  soon  as  practicable,  but \\nno  later  than  July  26,  1993.  Being  made  ac-\\ncessible,  for  this  purpose,  means  complying \\nwith the applicable provisions of appendix A \\nto this part. ‘‘As soon as practicable’’ means \\nthat, if modification can be made before July \\n26,  1993,  they  must  be.  A  rail  operator  that \\nfailed  to  make  a  station  accessible  by  July \\n1993  would  be  in  noncompliance  with  the \\nADA and this rule, except in a case where an \\nextension of time had been granted. \\n\\nWhat is a key station? A key station is one \\ndesignated as such by the commuter author-\\nity  or  light/rapid  rail  operator,  through  the \\nplanning  process  and  public  participation \\nprocess set forth in this section. The five cri-\\nteria listed in the regulation are intended to \\nguide the selection process but, while the en-\\ntity  must  take  these  criteria  into  account \\n(and  this  consideration  must  be  reflected  in \\nthe  planning  process  and  documents),  they \\nare not mandatory selection standards. That \\nis,  it  is  not  required  that  every  station  that \\nmeets  one  of  the  criteria  be  designated  as  a \\nkey  station.  Since  the  criteria  are  not  man-\\ndatory  selection  standards,  the  under-\\nstanding  of  their  terms  is  also  a  matter  ap-\\npropriately  left  to  the  planning  process.  A \\ntight,  legalistic  definition  is  not  necessary \\nin the context of factors intended for consid-\\neration.  For  instance,  what  constitutes  a \\nmajor activity center or how close a station \\nneeds to be to another station to not be des-\\nignated  as  key  depend  largely  on  local  fac-\\ntors that it would not be reasonable to speci-\\nfy in this rule. \\n\\nGiven the wide discretion permitted to rail \\noperators  in  identifying  key  stations,  there \\nwould be no objection to identifying as a key \\nstation  a  new  (presumably  accessible)  sta-\\ntion now under construction. Doing so would \\ninvolve consideration of the key station cri-\\nteria  and  would  be  subject  to  the  planning/ \\npublic participation process. \\n\\nIf  an  extension  to  a  rail  system  (e.g.,  a \\ncommuter  system)  is  made,  such  that  the \\nsystem  comes  to  include  existing  inacces-\\nsible  stations  that  have  not  previously  been \\npart  of  the  system,  the  Department  con-\\nstrues the ADA to require application of key \\nstation accessibility in such a situation. The \\nsame  would  be  true  for  a  new  start  com-\\nmuter  rail  system  that  began  operations \\nusing  existing  stations.  Key  station  plan-\\nning,  designation  of  key  stations,  and  with \\nbeing  consistent  with  the  ADA  would  be  re-\\nquired. The Department would work with the \\ncommuter  authority  involved  on  a  case-by- \\ncase basis to determine applicable time  lim-\\nits for accessibility, consistent with the time \\nframes of the ADA. \\n\\nThe  entity  must  develop  a  compliance \\nplan, subject to the public participation and \\nplanning process set forth in paragraph (d) of \\neach  of  these  sections.  Note  that  this  plan \\nmust be completed by July 26, 1992, not Jan-\\nuary  26,  1992,  as  in  the  case  of  paratransit \\nplans.  The  key  station  plans  must  be  sub-\\nmitted  to  FTA  at  that  time.  (The  statute \\ndoes  not  require  FTA  approval  of  the  plans, \\nhowever.). \\n\\nA  rail  operator  may  request  an  extension \\nof  the  July  1993  completion  deadline  for  ac-\\ncessibility modifications to one or more key \\nstations.  The  extension  for  light  and  rapid \\nrail  stations  can  be  up  to  July  2020,  though \\ntwo thirds of the key stations (per the legis-\\nlative  history  of  the  statute,  selected  in  a \\nway  to  maximize  accessibility  to  the  whole \\nsystem) must be accessible by July 2010. \\n\\nCommuter rail stations can be extended up \\n\\nto July 2010. \\n\\nRequests  for  extension  of  time  must  be \\nsubmitted  by  July  26,  1992.

However, since we are aware that, in \\nthe absence of an extension request, accessi-\\nbility  must  be  completed  by  July  1993,  we \\nwill endeavor to complete review of plans as \\nsoon  as  possible,  to  give  as  much  lead  time \\nas  possible  to  local  planning  and  implemen-\\ntation efforts. \\n\\nOnce  an  extension  is  granted,  the  exten-\\nsion applies to all accessibility modifications \\nin  the  station.  However,  the  rail  operator \\nshould  not  delay  non-extraordinarily  expen-\\nsive  modifications  to  the  station.  The  key \\nstation  plan  and  any  extension  request \\nshould include a schedule for phasing in non- \\nextraordinarily  expensive  modifications  to \\nthe  station.  For  example,  even  if  a  key  sta-\\ntion  is  not  going  to  be  accessible  to  wheel-\\nchair users for 15 years, pending the installa-\\ntion of an elevator, the rail operator can im-\\nprove its accessibility to persons with visual \\nimpairments by installing tactile strips. \\n\\nAn  extension  cannot  be  granted  except  for \\na  particular  station  which  needs  an  extraor-\\ndinarily  expensive  modification.  An  exten-\\nsion  cannot  be  granted  non-extraordinarily \\nexpensive  changes  to  Station  B  because  the \\nextraordinarily expensive changes to Station \\nA  will  absorb  many  resources.  Non-extraor-\\ndinarily  expensive  changes,  however  costly \\nconsidered collectively for a system, are not, \\nunder  the  statute,  grounds  for  granting  an \\nextension  to  one  or  more  stations  or  the \\nwhole  system.  Only  particular  stations \\nwhere an extraordinarily expensive modifica-\\ntion must be made qualify for extensions. \\n\\nThe FTA Administrator can approve, mod-\\nify,  or  disapprove  any  request  for  an  exten-\\nsion. For example, it is not a forgone conclu-\\nsion  that  a  situation  for  which  an  extension \\nis  granted  will  have  the  maximum  possible \\nextension granted. If it appears that the rail \\noperator  can  make  some  stations  accessible \\nsooner,  FTA  can  grant  an  extension  for  a \\nshorter period (e.g., 2005 for a particular sta-\\ntion rather than 2010). \\n\\nSection 37.53 Exception for New York and \\nPhiladelphia \\n\\nConsistent  with  the  legislative  history  of \\nthe  ADA,  this  section  formally  recognizes \\nthe  selection  of  key  stations  in  two  identi-\\nfied litigation settlement agreements in New \\nYork and Philadelphia as in compliance with \\nthe ADA. Consequently, the entities involved \\ncan  limit  their  key station  planning process \\nto  issues  concerning  the  timing  of  key  sta-\\ntion  accessibility.  The  section  references \\nalso  § 37.9,  which  provides  that  key  station \\naccessibility  alterations  which  have  already \\nbeen  made,  or  which  are  begun  before  Janu-\\nary  26,  1992,  and  which  conform  to  specified \\nprior  standards,  do  not  have  to  be  re-modi-\\nfied.  On  the  other  hand,  alterations  begun \\nafter January 25, 1992 (including forthcoming \\nkey  station  modifications  under  the  New \\nYork  and  Philadelphia  agreements),  must \\n\\nmeet the requirements of appendix A to this \\npart. \\n\\nThis is an exception only for the two speci-\\nfied  agreements.  There  are  no  situations  in \\nwhich other cities can take advantage of this \\nprovision.  Nor  are  the  provisions  of  the  two \\nagreements normative for other cities. Other \\ncities  must  do  their  own  planning,  with  in-\\nvolvement  from  local  citizens,  and  cannot \\nrely on agreements unique to New York and \\nPhiladelphia  to  determine  the  appropriate \\nnumber  of  percentage  of  key  stations  or \\nother matters. \\n\\nSection 37.57 Required Cooperation \\n\\nThis  section  implements  § 242(e)(2)(C)  of \\nthe  ADA,  which  treats  as  discrimination  a \\nfailure,  by  an  owner  or  person  in  control  of \\nan  intercity  rail  station,  to  provide  reason-\\nable  cooperation  to  the  responsible  persons’ \\nefforts  to  comply  with  accessibility  require-\\nments.  For  example,  the  imposition  by  the \\nowner  of  an  unreasonable  insurance  bond \\nfrom the responsible person as a condition of \\nmaking  accessibility  modifications  would \\nviolate this requirement. See H. Rept. 101–485 \\nat 53. \\n\\nThe  statute  also  provides  that  failure  of \\nthe  owner  or  person  in  control  to  cooperate \\ndoes not create a defense to a discrimination \\nsuit  against  the  responsible  person,  but  the \\nresponsible  person  would  have  a  third  party \\naction  against  the  uncooperative  owner  or \\nperson  in  control.  The  rule  does  not  restate \\nthis portion of the statute in the regulation, \\nsince it would be implemented by the courts \\nif  such  an  action  is  brought.  Since  coopera-\\ntion  is  also  a  regulatory  requirement,  how-\\never,  the  Department  could  entertain  a  sec-\\ntion 504 complaint against a recipient of Fed-\\neral funds who failed to cooperate. \\n\\nThe  House  Energy  and  Commerce  Com-\\nmittee  provided  as  an  example  of  an  action \\nunder  this  provision  a  situation  in  which  a \\nfailure  to  cooperate  leads  to  a  construction \\ndelay, which in turn leads to a lawsuit by an \\nindividual  with  disabilities  against  the  re-\\nsponsible person for missing an accessibility \\ndeadline.  The  responsible  person  could  not \\nuse  the  lack  of  cooperation  as  a  defense  in \\nthe  lawsuit,  but  the  uncooperative  party \\ncould  be  made  to  indemnify  the  responsible \\nperson  for  damages  awarded  the  plaintiff. \\nAlso, a responsible person could obtain an in-\\njunction  to  force  the  recalcitrant  owner  or \\ncontroller  of  the  station  to  permit  accessi-\\nbility work to proceed. (Id.) \\n\\nThis  provision  does  not  appear  to  be  in-\\ntended to permit a responsible person to seek \\ncontribution  for  a  portion  of  the  cost  of  ac-\\ncessibility  work  from  a  party  involved  with \\nthe  station  whom  the  statute  and  § 37.49  do \\nnot  identify  as  a  responsible  person.  It  sim-\\nply  provides  a  remedy  for  a  situation  in \\nwhich  someone  impedes  the  responsible  per-\\nson’s efforts to comply with accessibility ob-\\nligations. \\n\\n497 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00507 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cPt. 37, App. D \\n\\n49 CFR Subtitle A (10–1–21 Edition) \\n\\nSection 37.59 Differences in Accessibility \\nCompletion Date Requirements \\n\\nPortions of the same station may have dif-\\nferent accessibility completion date require-\\nments,  both  as  the  result  of  different  statu-\\ntory  time  frames  for  different  kinds  of  sta-\\ntions  and  individual  decisions  made  on  re-\\nquests  for  extension.  The  principle  at  work \\nin  responding  to  such  situations  is  that  if \\npart  of  a  station  may  be  made  accessible \\nafter  another  part,  the  ‘‘late’’  part  of  the \\nwork  should  not  get  in  the  way  of  people’s \\nuse  of  modifications  resulting  from  the \\n‘‘early’’ part. \\n\\nFor  example,  the  commuter  part  of  a  sta-\\ntion may have to be made accessible by July \\n1993 (e.g., there is no need to install an eleva-\\ntor,  and  platform  accessibility  can  be \\nachieved  by  use  of  a  relatively  inexpensive \\nmini-high  platform).  The  Amtrak  portion  of \\nthe  same  station,  by  statute,  is  required  to \\nbe  accessible  as  soon  as  practicable,  but  no \\nlater than July 2010. If there is a common en-\\ntrance  to  the  station,  that  commuter  rail \\npassengers  and  Amtrak  passengers  both  use, \\nor  a  common  ticket  counter,  it  would  have \\nto be accessible by July 1993. If there were a \\nwaiting room used by Amtrak passengers but \\nnot  commuter  passengers  (who  typically \\nstand  and  wait  on  the  platform  at  this  sta-\\ntion),  it  would  not  have  to  be  accessible  by \\nJuly  1993,  but  if  the  path  from  the  common \\nentrance  to  the  commuter  platform  went \\nthrough  the  waiting  room,  the  path  would \\nhave to be an accessible path by July 1993. \\n\\nSection 37.61 Public Transportation Programs \\nand Activities in Existing Facilities \\n\\nThis  section  implements  section  228(a)  of \\nthe ADA and establishes the general require-\\nment  for  entities  to  operate  their  transpor-\\ntation  facilities  in  a  manner  that,  when \\nviewed  in  its  entirety,  is  accessible  to  and \\nusable  by  individuals  with  disabilities.  The \\nsection  clearly  excludes  from  this  require-\\nment  access  by  persons  in  wheelchairs,  un-\\nless  these  changes  would  be  necessitated  by \\nthe alterations or key station provisions. \\n\\nThis  provision  is  intended  to  cover  activi-\\nties  and  programs  of  an  entity  that  do  not \\nrise to the level of alteration. Even if an en-\\ntity  is  not  making  alterations  to  a  facility, \\nit  has  a  responsibility  to  conduct  its  pro-\\ngram  in  an  accessible  manner.  Examples  of \\npossible  activities  include  user  friendly \\nfarecards,  schedules,  of  edge  detection  on \\nrail  platforms,  adequate \\nlighting,  tele-\\ncommunication  display  devices  (TDDs)  or \\ntext  telephones,  and  other  accommodations \\nfor  use  by  persons  with  speech  and  hearing \\nimpairments,  signage  for  people  with  visual \\nimpairments,  continuous  pathways  for  per-\\nsons  with  visual  and  ambulatory  impair-\\nments,  and  public  address  systems  and \\nclocks. \\n\\nThe  Department  did  not  prescribe  one  list \\nof  things  that  would  be  appropriate  for  all \\nstations.  For  example,  we  believe  that  tac-\\ntile  strips  are  a  valuable  addition  to  plat-\\nforms  which  have  drop-offs.  We  also  believe \\nthat most larger systems, to the extent they \\npublish  schedules,  should  make  those  sched-\\nules readily available in alternative formats. \\nWe  encourage  entities  to  find  this  another \\narea which benefits from its commitment to \\nfar-reaching public participation efforts. \\n\\nSUBPART D—ACQUISITION OF ACCESSIBLE \\nVEHICLES BY PUBLIC ENTITIES \\n\\nSection  37.71 Purchase  or  Lease  of  New  Non- \\nRail  Vehicles  by  Public  Entities  Operating \\nFixed Route Systems \\n\\nThis  section  generally  sets  out  the  basic \\nacquisition  requirements  for  a  public  entity \\npurchasing  a  new  vehicle.  The  section  re-\\nquires  any  public  entity  that  purchases  or \\nleases a new vehicle to acquire an accessible \\nvehicle. \\n\\nIn  addition,  the  waiver  request  must  in-\\nclude  copies  of  advertisements  in  trade  pub-\\nlications  and  inquiries  to  trade  associations \\nseeking lifts for the buses. The public entity \\nalso must include a full justification for the \\nassertion  that  a  delay  in  the  bus  procure-\\nment sufficient to obtain a lift-equipped bus \\nwould  significantly  impair  transportation \\nservices  in  the  community.  There  is  no \\nlength  of  time  that  would  be  a  per  se  delay \\nconstituting  a  ‘‘significant  impairment’’.  It \\nwill be more difficult to obtain a waiver if a \\nrelatively  short  rather  than  relatively \\nlengthy delay is involved. A showing of time-\\ntables,  absent  a  showing  of  significant  im-\\npairment  of  actual  transit  services,  would \\nnot form a basis for granting a waiver. \\n\\nAny  waiver  granted  by  the  Department \\nunder  this  provision  will  be  a  conditional \\nwaiver.  The  conditions  are  intended  to  en-\\nsure  that  the  waiver  provision  does  not  cre-\\nate  a  loophole  in  the  accessible  vehicle  ac-\\nquisition  requirement  that  Congress  in-\\ntended to impose. The ADA requires a waiver \\nto  be  limited  in  duration  and  the  rule  re-\\nquires a termination date to be included. The \\ndate  will  be  established  on  the  basis  of  the \\ninformation  the  Department  receives  con-\\ncerning the availability of lifts in the waiver \\nrequest and elsewhere. In addition, so that a \\nwaiver  does  not  become  open-ended,  it  will \\napply  only  to  a  particular  procurement.  If  a \\ntransit  agency  wants  a  waiver  for  a  subse-\\nquent  delivery  of  buses  in  the  procurement, \\nor another procurement entirely, it will have \\nto make a separate waiver request. \\n\\nFor example, if a particular order of buses \\nis delivered over a period of time, each deliv-\\nery would be the potential subject of a waiv-\\ner request. First, the entity would request a \\nwaiver  for  the  first  shipment  of  buses.  If  all \\nof  the  conditions  are  met,  the  waiver  would \\nbe granted, with a date specified to coincide \\n\\n498 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00508 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cOffice of the Secretary of Transportation \\n\\nPt. 37, App. D \\n\\nwith the due date of the lifts. When the lifts \\nbecome  available  those  buses  would  have  to \\nbe  retrofitted  with  the  lifts.  A  subsequent \\ndelivery  of  buses—on  the  same  order—would \\nhave to receive its own waiver, subject to the \\nsame  conditions  and  specifications  of  the \\nfirst waiver. \\n\\nThe  purpose  of  the  waiver,  as  the  Depart-\\nment  construes  it,  is  to  address  a  situation \\nin which (because of a sudden increase in the \\nnumber  of  lift-equipped  buses  requested)  lift \\nmanufacturers are unable to produce enough \\nlifts to meet the demand in a timely fashion. \\n\\nSection  37.73 Purchase  or  Lease  of  Used  Non- \\nRail  Vehicles  by  Public  Entities  Operating  a \\nFixed Route System \\n\\nThe  basic  rule  is  that  an  acquisition  of  a \\nused  vehicle  would  have  to  be  for  an  acces-\\nsible vehicle. \\n\\nThere  is  an  exception,  however,  for  situa-\\ntions  in  which  the  transit  provider  makes  a \\ngood  faith  effort  to  obtain  accessible  used \\nvehicles  but  does  not  succeed  in  finding \\nthem.  The  ADA  requires  transit  agencies  to \\npurchase  accessible  used  vehicles,  providing \\na  ‘‘demonstrated  good  faith  efforts’’  excep-\\ntion  to  the  requirement.  The  reports  of  the \\nSenate  Committee  on  Labor  and Human Re-\\nsources  and  the  House  Committee  on  Edu-\\ncation  and  Labor  offered  the  following  guid-\\nance on what ‘‘good faith efforts’’ involve: \\n\\nThe  phrase  ‘‘demonstrated  good  faith  ef-\\nforts’’  is  intended  to  require  a  nationwide \\nsearch  and  not  a  search  limited  to  a  par-\\nticular region. For instance, it would not be \\nenough for a transit operator to contact only \\nthe  manufacturer  where  the  transit  author-\\nity  usually  does  business  to  see  if  there  are \\naccessible used buses. It involves the transit \\nauthority  advertising  in  a  trade  magazine, \\ni.e.,  Passenger  Transport,  or  contacting  the \\ntransit  trade  association,  American  Public \\nTransit  Association  (APTA),  to  determine \\nwhether  accessible  used  vehicles  are  avail-\\nable.  It  is  the  Committee’s  expectation  that \\nas  the  number  of  buses  with  lifts  increases, \\nthe  burden  on  the  transit  authority  to  dem-\\nonstrate  its  inability  to  purchase  accessible \\nvehicles  despite  good  faith  efforts  will  be-\\ncome  more  and  more  difficult  to  satisfy.  S. \\nRept. 101–116 at 49; H. Rept. 101–485 at 90. \\n\\nConsistent with this guidance, this section \\nrequires that good faith efforts include speci-\\nfying accessible vehicles in bid solicitations. \\nThe section also requires that the entity re-\\ntain for two years documentation of that ef-\\nfort,  and  that  the  information  be  available \\nto FTA and the public. \\n\\nIt  does  not  meet  the  good  faith  efforts  re-\\nquirement  to  purchase  inaccessible,  rather \\nthan accessible, used buses, just because the \\nformer are less expensive, particularly if the \\ndifference  is  a  difference  attributable  to  the \\npresence of a lift. There may be situations in \\nwhich good faith efforts involve buying fewer \\n\\naccessible  buses  in  preference  to  more  inac-\\ncessible buses. \\n\\nThe  public  participation  requirements  in-\\nvolved in the development of the paratransit \\nplans  for  all  fixed  route  operators  requires \\nan  ongoing  relationship,  including  extensive \\noutreach,  to  the  community  likely  to  be \\nusing  its  accessible  service.  We  believe  that \\nit will be difficult to comply with the public \\nparticipation  requirements  and  not  involve \\nthe affected community in the decisions con-\\ncerning  the  purchase  or  lease  of  used  acces-\\nsible vehicles. \\n\\nThere  is  an  exception  to  these  require-\\nments  for  donated  vehicles.  Not  all  ‘‘zero \\ndollar’’  transfers  are  donations,  however. \\nThe legislative history to this provision pro-\\nvides insight. \\n\\nIt  is  not  the  Committee’s  intent  to  make \\nthe  vehicle  accessibility  provisions  of  this \\ntitle applicable to vehicles donated to a pub-\\nlic  entity.  The  Committee  understands  that \\nit is not usual to donate vehicles to a public \\nentity.  However,  there  could  be  instances \\nwhere  someone  could  conceivably  donate  a \\nbus to a public transit operator in a  will. In \\nsuch a case, the transit operators should not \\nbe prevented from accepting a gift. \\n\\nThe  Committee  does  not  intend  that  this \\nlimited  exemption  for  donated  vehicles  be \\nused  to  circumvent  the  intent  of  the  ADA. \\nFor example, a local transit authority could \\nnot arrange to be the recipient of donated in-\\naccessible buses. This would be a violation of \\nthe  ADA.  S.  Rpt.  101–116,  at  46;  H.  Rpt.  101– \\n486, at 87. \\n\\nEntities  interested  in  accepting  donated \\nvehicles  must  submit  a  request  to  FTA  to \\nverify that the transaction is a donation. \\n\\nThere  is  one  situation,  in  which  a  vehicle \\nhas prior use is not treated as a used vehicle. \\nIf a vehicle has been remanufactured, and it \\nis  within  the  period  of  the  extension  of  its \\nuseful life, it is not viewed as a used vehicle \\n(see H. Rept. 101–485, Pt 1 at 27). During this \\nperiod, such a vehicle may be acquired by an-\\nother entity without going through the good \\nfaith  efforts  process.  This  is  because,  at  the \\ntime  of  its  remanufacture,  the  bus  would \\nhave  been  made  as  accessible  if  feasible. \\nWhen the vehicle has completed its extended \\nuseful  life  (e.g.,  the  beginning  of  year  six \\nwhen its useful life has extended five years), \\nit becomes subject to used bus requirements. \\n\\nSection 37.75 Remanufacture of Non-Rail Vehi-\\ncles  and  Purchase  or  Lease  of  Remanufac-\\ntured Non-rail Vehicles by Public Entities Op-\\nerating Fixed Route Systems \\n\\nThis  section  tracks  the  statute  closely, \\nand contains the following provisions.

The  ADA  legislative \\nhistory makes it clear that remanufacture is \\nto include changes to the structure of the ve-\\nhicle which extend the useful life of the vehi-\\ncle  for  five  years.  It  clearly  is  not  intended \\nto  capture  things  such  as  engine  overhauls \\nand the like. \\n\\nThe  term  remanufacture,  as  used  in  the \\nADA context, is different from the use of the \\nterm in previously issued FTA guidance. The \\nterm has a specific meaning under the ADA: \\nthere  must  be  structural  work  done  to  the \\nvehicle  and  the  work  must  extend  the  vehi-\\ncle’s useful life by five years. \\n\\nThe ADA imposes no requirements on what \\nFTA  traditionally  considers  bus  rehabilita-\\ntion. Such work involves rebuilding a bus to \\noriginal  specifications  and  focuses  on  me-\\nchanical  systems  and  interiors.  Often  this \\nwork  includes  replacing  components.  It  is \\nless extensive than remanufacture. \\n\\nThe  statute,  and  the  rule,  includes  an  ex-\\nception  for  the  remanufacture  of  historical \\nvehicles.  This  exception  applies  to  the  re-\\nmanufacture  of  or  purchase  of  a  remanufac-\\ntured vehicle that (1) is of historic character; \\n(2)  operates  solely  on  a  segment  of  a  fixed \\nroute  system  which  is  on  the  National  Reg-\\nister  of  Historic  Places;  and  (3)  making  the \\nvehicle  accessible  would  significantly  alter \\nthe historic character of the vehicle. The ex-\\nception  only  extends  to  the  remanufacture \\nthat would alter the historic character of the \\nvehicle.  All  modifications  that  can  be  made \\nwithout altering the historic character (such \\nas slip resistant flooring) must be done. \\n\\nSection  37.77 Purchase  or  Lease  of  New  Non- \\nRail  Vehicles  by  Public  Entities  Operating  a \\nDemand  Responsive  System  for  the  General \\nPublic \\n\\nSection 224 of the ADA requires that a pub-\\nlic entity operating a demand responsive sys-\\ntem  purchase  or  lease  accessible  new  vehi-\\ncles,  for  which  a  solicitation  is  made  after \\nAugust  25,  1990,  unless  the  system,  when \\nviewed  in  its  entirety,  provides  a  level  of \\nservice  to  individuals  with  disabilities,  in-\\ncluding  individuals  who  use  wheelchairs, \\nequivalent to the level of service provided to \\nindividuals without disabilities. This section \\nis  the  same  as  the  October  4,  1990  final  rule \\nwhich  promulgated  the  immediately  effec-\\ntive acquisition requirements of the ADA. \\n\\nThe  Department  has  been  asked  to  clarify \\nwhat  ‘‘accessible  when  viewed  in  its  en-\\ntirety’’ means in the context of a demand re-\\nsponsive  system  being  allowed  to  purchase \\nan inaccessible vehicle. First, it is important \\nto  note  that  this  exception  applies  only  to \\ndemand  responsive  systems  (and  not  fixed \\nroute  systems).  The  term  ‘‘equivalent  serv-\\nice’’ was discussed during the passage of the \\nADA.  Material  from  the  legislative  history \\nindicates  that  ‘‘when  viewed  in  its  entirety/ \\nequivalent service’’ means that ‘‘when all as-\\npects  of  a  transportation  system  are  ana-\\n\\nlyzed,  equal  opportunities  for  each  indi-\\nvidual  with  a  disability  to  use  the  transpor-\\ntation  system  must  exist.

For exam-\\nple,  both  reports  said  that  ‘‘the  time  delay \\nbetween  a  phone  call  to  access  the  demand \\nresponsive system and pick up the individual \\nis not greater because the individual needs a \\nlift  or  ramp  or  other  accommodation  to  ac-\\ncess the vehicle.’’ (Id.) \\n\\nConsistent  with  this,  the  Department  has \\nspecified  certain  service  criteria  that  are  to \\nbe  used  when  determining  if  the  service  is \\nequivalent.  As  in  previous  rulemakings  on \\nthis  provision,  the  standards  (which  include \\nservice area, response time, fares, hours and \\ndays of service, trip purpose restrictions, in-\\nformation  and  reservations  capability,  and \\nother  capacity  constraints)  are  not  absolute \\nstandards.  They  do  not  say,  for  example, \\nthat  a  person  with  a  disability  must  be \\npicked up in a specified number of hours. The \\nrequirement is that there must be equivalent \\nservice  for  all  passengers,  whether  or  not \\nthey have a disability. If the system provides \\nservice to persons without disabilities within \\nfour  hours  of  a  call  for  service,  then  pas-\\nsengers  with  disabilities  must  be  afforded \\nthe same service. \\n\\nThe  Department  has  been  asked  specifi-\\ncally  where  an  entity  should  send  its \\n‘‘equivalent  level  of  service’’  certifications. \\nWe provide the following: Equivalent level of \\nservice certifications should be submitted to \\nthe  state  program  office  if  you  are  a  public \\nentity  receiving  FTA  funds  through  the \\nstate.  All  other  entities  should  submit  their \\nequivalent  level  of  service  certifications  to \\nthe FTA regional office (listed in appendix B \\nof  this  part).  Certifications  must  be  sub-\\nmitted before the acquisition of the vehicles. \\nParagraph  (e)  of  this  section  authorizes  a \\nwaiver  for  the  unavailability  of  lifts.  Since \\ndemand  responsive  systems  need  not  pur-\\nchase  accessible  vehicles  if  they  can  certify \\nequivalent service, the Department has been \\nasked  what  this  provision  is  doing  in  this \\nsection. \\n\\nParagraph  (e)  applies  in  the  case  in  which \\nan  entity  operates  a  demand  responsive  sys-\\ntem, which is not equivalent, and the entity \\ncannot find accessible vehicles to acquire. In \\nthis case, the waiver provisions applicable to \\na fixed route entity purchasing or leasing in-\\naccessible  new  vehicles  applies  to  the  de-\\nmand responsive operator as well. \\n\\nSection  37.79 Purchase  or  Lease  of  New  Rail \\nVehicles  by  Public  Entities  Operating  Rapid \\nor Light Rail Systems \\n\\nThis  section  echoes  the  requirement  of \\n\\n§ 37.71—all new rail cars must be accessible. \\n\\n500 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00510 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cOffice of the Secretary of Transportation \\n\\nPt. 37, App. D \\n\\nSection  37.81 Purchase  or  Lease  of  Used  Rail \\nVehicles  by  Public  Entities  Operating  Rapid \\nor Light Rail Systems \\n\\nThis  section  lays  out  the  requirements  for \\na public entity acquiring a used rail vehicle. \\nThe  requirements  and  standards  are  the \\nsame  as  those  specified  for  non-rail  vehicles \\nin  § 37.73.  While  we  recognize  it  may  create \\ndifficulties  for  entities  in  some  situations, \\nthe statute does not include any extension or \\nshort-term leases. The Department will con-\\nsider,  in  a  case-by-case  basis,  how  the  good \\nfaith  efforts  requirement  would  apply in the \\ncase of an agreement between rail carriers to \\npermit  quick-response,  short-term  leases  of \\ncars over a period of time. \\n\\nSection  37.83 Remanufacture  of  Rail  Vehicles \\nand  Purchase  or  Lease  of  Remanufactured \\nRail  Vehicles  by  Public  Entities  Operating \\nRapid or Light Rail System \\n\\nThis section parallels the remanufacturing \\nsection for buses, including the exception for \\nhistorical vehicles. With respect to an entity \\nhaving  a  class  of  historic  vehicles  that  may \\nmeet  the  standards  for  the  historic  vehicle \\nexception  (e.g.,  San  Francisco  cable  cars), \\nthe  Department  would  not  object  to  a  re-\\nquest  for  application  of  the  exception  on  a \\nsystem-wide,  as  approved  to  car-by-car, \\nbasis. \\n\\nSection 37.85 Purchase or Lease of New \\nIntercity and Commuter Rail Cars \\n\\nThis section incorporates the statutory re-\\nquirement that new intercity and commuter \\nrail  cars  be  accessible.  The  specific  accessi-\\nbility provisions of the statute (for example, \\nthere  are  slightly  different  requirements  for \\nintercity  rail  cars  versus  commuter  rail \\ncars)  are  specified  in  part  38  of  this  regula-\\ntion.  These  standards  are  adopted  from  the \\nvoluntary  guidelines  issues  by  the  Access \\nBoard. The section basically parallels the ac-\\nquisition  requirements  for  buses  and  other \\nvehicles.  It  should  be  noted  that  the  defini-\\ntion  of  commuter  rail  operator  clearly  al-\\nlows  for  additional  operators  to  qualify  as \\ncommuter, since the definition describes the \\nfunctional  characteristics  of  an  operator,  as \\nwell as listing existing commuter rail opera-\\ntors. \\n\\nWe  would  point  out  that  the  ADA  applies \\nthis requirement to all new vehicles. This in-\\ncludes  not  only  vehicles  and  systems  that \\ncurrently are being operated in the U.S., but \\nnew,  experimental,  or  imported  vehicles  and \\nsystems. The ADA does not stand in the way \\nof  new  technology,  but  it  does  require  that \\nnew  technology,  and  the  benefits  it  brings, \\nbe  accessible  to  all  persons,  including  those \\nwith disabilities. This point applies to all ve-\\nhicle  acquisition  provisions  of  this  regula-\\ntion,  whether  for  rail  or  non-rail,  private  or \\npublic,  fixed  route  or  demand  responsive  ve-\\nhicles and systems. \\n\\nSection 37.87 Purchase or Lease of Used \\nIntercity and Commuter Rail Cars \\n\\nThe  section  also  parallels  closely  the  re-\\nquirements  in  the  ADA  for  the  purchase  or \\nlease  of  accessible  used  rail  vehicles.  We  ac-\\nknowledge that, in some situations, the stat-\\nutory requirement for to make good faith ef-\\nforts to acquire accessible used vehicles may \\ncreate difficulties for rail operators attempt-\\ning to lease rail cars quickly for a short time \\n(e.g.,  as  fill-ins  for  cars  which  need  repairs). \\nIn some cases, it may be possible to mitigate \\nthese  difficulties  through  means  such  as \\nmaking good faith efforts with respect to an \\noverall  agreement  between  two  rail  opera-\\ntors  to  make  cars  available  to  one  another \\nwhen  needed,  rather  than  each  time  a  car  is \\nprovided under such an agreement. \\n\\nSection 37.89 Remanufacture of Intercity and \\nCommuter Rail Cars \\n\\nThis  section  requires  generally  that  re-\\nmanufactured cars be made accessible, to the \\nmaximum extent feasible. Feasible is defined \\nin paragraph (c) of the section to be ‘‘unless \\nan  engineering  analysis  demonstrates  that \\nremanufacturing  the  car  to  be  accessible \\nwould  have  a  significant  adverse  effect  on \\nthe  structural  integrity  of  the  car.’’  In-\\ncreased cost is not a reason for viewing other \\nsections  of  this  subpart  concerning  remanu-\\nfactured vehicles. \\n\\nIn  addition,  this  section  differs  from  the \\ncounterpart  sections  for  non-rail  vehicles \\nand light and rapid rail vehicles in two ways. \\nFirst,  the  extension  of  useful  life  needed  to \\ntrigger  the  section  is  ten  rather  than  five \\nyears. Second, there is no historic vehicle ex-\\nception.  Both  of  these  differences  are  statu-\\ntory. \\n\\nRemanufacture  of  vehicles  implies  work \\nthat extends their expected useful life of the \\nvehicle.  A  mid-life  overhaul,  not  extending \\nthe total useful life of the vehicle, would not \\nbe viewed as a remanufacture of the vehicle. \\n\\nSection 37.93 One Car Per Train Rule \\n\\nincluding \\n\\nThis  section  implements  the  statutory  di-\\nrective  that  all  rail  operators  (light,  rapid, \\ncommuter  and  intercity)  have  at  least  one \\ncar  per  train  accessible  to  persons  with  dis-\\nabilities, \\nindividuals  who  use \\nwheelchairs  by  July  26,  1995.  (See  ADA  sec-\\ntions  242(a)(1),  242(b)(1),  228(b)(1).)  Section \\n37.93  contains  this  general  requirement.  In \\nsome  cases,  entities  will  meet  the  one-car- \\nper  train  rule  through  the  purchase  of  new \\ncars. In this case, since all new rail vehicles \\nhave  to  be  accessible,  compliance  with  this \\nprovision is straightforward. \\n\\nHowever,  certain  entities  may  not  be  pur-\\nchasing any new vehicles by July 26, 1995, or \\nmay  not  be  purchasing  enough  vehicles  to \\nensure that one car per train is accessible. In \\nthese  cases,  these  entities  will  have  to  ret-\\nrofit existing cars to meet this requirement. \\n\\n501 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00511 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cPt. 37, App. D \\n\\n49 CFR Subtitle A (10–1–21 Edition) \\n\\nWhat  a  retrofitted  car  must  look  like  to \\nmeet  the  requirement  has  been  decided  by \\nthe  Access  Board.

It  is  impor-\\ntant  to  note  that  some  portions  of  this  sec-\\ntion (referring to response time, reservations \\ncapacity,  and  restrictions  on  trip  purpose) \\napply  only  to  demand  responsive  systems. \\nAnother  provision  (schedules/headways)  ap-\\nplies only to fixed route systems. This is be-\\ncause  these  points  of  comparison  apply  only \\nto one or the other type system. The remain-\\ning  provisions  apply  to  both  kinds  of  sys-\\ntems. \\n\\nIn  applying  the  provisions  this  section,  it \\nis  important  to  note  that  they  are  only \\npoints  of  comparison,  not  substantive  cri-\\nteria. For example, unlike the response time \\ncriterion  of  § 37.131,  this  section  does  not  re-\\nquire  that  a  system  provide  any  particular \\nresponse time. All it says is that, in order for \\nthere  to  be  equivalency,  if  the  demand  re-\\nsponsive system gets a van to a non-disabled \\nperson  in  2  hours,  or  8  hours,  or  a  week  and \\na  half  after  a  call  for  service,  the  system \\nmust  get  an  accessible  van  to  a  person  with \\na disability in 2 hours, or 8 hours, or a week \\nand a half. \\n\\nThe  vehicle  acquisition  and  equivalency \\nprovisions  work  together  in  the  following \\nway.  A  private  entity  is  about  to  acquire  a \\nvehicle for a transportation service in one of \\nthe  categories  to  which  equivalency  is  rel-\\nevant. The entity looks at its present service \\n(considered  without  regard  to  the  vehicle  it \\nplans  to  acquire).  Does  the  present  service \\nmeet  the  equivalency  standard?  (In  answer-\\ning  this  question,  the  point  of  reference  is \\nthe  next  potential  customer  who  needs  an \\naccessible  vehicle.  The  fact  that  such  per-\\nsons  have  not  called  in  the  past  is  irrele-\\nvant).  If  not,  the  entity  is  required  to  ac-\\nquire  an  accessible  vehicle.  If  so,  the  entity \\nmay acquire an accessible or an inaccessible \\nvehicle. This process must be followed every \\ntime the entity purchases or leases a vehicle. \\nGiven  changes  in  the  mixes  of  both  cus-\\ntomers and vehicles, the answer to the ques-\\ntion  about  equivalency  will  probably  not  be \\nthe same for an entity every time it is asked. \\nOne  difference  between  the  requirements \\nfor  ‘‘private,  not  primarily’’  and  ‘‘private, \\nprimarily’’  entities  is  that  the  requirements \\napply  to  all  vehicles  purchased  or  leased  for \\n\\n502 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00512 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cOffice of the Secretary of Transportation \\n\\nPt. 37, App. D \\n\\nthe  former,  but  only  to  new  vehicles  for  the \\nlatter. This means that entities in the latter \\ncategory  are  not  required  to  acquire  acces-\\nsible  vehicles  when  they  purchase  or  lease \\nused  vehicles.  Another  oddity  in  the  statute \\nwhich  entities  should  note  is  that  the  re-\\nquirement  for  ‘‘private,  primarily’’  entities \\nto  acquire  accessible  vans  with  less  than \\neight  passenger  capacity  (or  provide  equiva-\\nlent  service) does  not  become  effective  until \\nafter  February  25,  1992  (This  also  date  also \\napplies  no  private  entities  ‘‘primarily  en-\\ngaged’’  which  purchase  passenger  rail  cars). \\nAll  other  vehicle  acquisition  requirements \\nbecame effective after August 25, 1990. \\n\\nThe  Department  views  the  line  between \\n‘‘private,  primarily’’  and  ‘‘private,  not  pri-\\nmarily’’ entities as being drawn with respect \\nto  the  bus,  van,  or  other  service  which  the \\nentity is providing. For example, there is an \\nobvious sense in which an airline or car rent-\\nal company is primarily engaged in the busi-\\nness  of  transporting  people.  If  the  airline  or \\ncar rental agency runs a shuttle bus from the \\nairport terminal to a downtown location or a \\nrental  car  lot,  however,  the  Department \\nviews  that  shuttle  service  as  covered  by  the \\n‘‘private, not primarily’’ requirements of the \\nrule  (see  discussion  of  the  Applicability  sec-\\ntions  above).  This  is  because  the  airline  or \\ncar rental agency is not primarily engaged in \\nthe  business  of  providing  transportation  by \\nbus  or  van.  The  relationship  of  the  bus  or \\nvan  service  to  an  airline’s  main  business  is \\nanalogous to that of a shuttle to a hotel. For \\nthis purpose, it is of only incidental interest \\nthat  the  main  business  of  the  airline  is  fly-\\ning people around the country instead of put-\\nting them up for the night. \\n\\nSection 37.109 Ferries and Other Passenger \\nVessels \\n\\nAlthough at this time there are no specific \\nrequirements  for  vessels,  ferries  and  other \\npassenger  vessels  operated  by  private  enti-\\nties  are  subject  to  the  requirements  of  § 37.5 \\nof this part and applicable requirements of 28 \\nCFR  part  36,  the  DOJ  rule  under  title  III  of \\nthe ADA. \\n\\nSUBPART F—PARATRANSIT AS A COMPLEMENT \\nTO FIXED ROUTE SERVICE \\n\\nSection 37.121 Requirement for Comparable \\nComplementary Paratransit Service \\n\\nThis  section  sets  forth  the  basic  require-\\nment  that  all  public  entities  who  operate  a \\nfixed  route  system  have  to  provide  para-\\ntransit  service  that  is  both  comparable  and \\ncomplementary to the fixed route service. By \\n‘‘complementary,’’ we mean service that acts \\nas  a  ‘‘safety  net’’  for  individuals  with  dis-\\nabilities who cannot use the fixed route sys-\\ntem. By ‘‘comparable,’’ we mean service that \\nmeets the service criteria of this subpart. \\n\\nThis requirement applies to light and rapid \\nrail  systems  as  well  as  to  bus  systems,  even \\n\\nwhen  rail  and  bus  systems  share  all  or  part \\nof  the  same  service  area.  Commuter  bus, \\ncommuter  rail  and  intercity  rail  systems  do \\nnot  have  to  provide  paratransit,  however. \\nThe  remaining  provisions  of  subpart  F  set \\nforth  the  details  of  the  eligibility  require-\\nments  for  paratransit,  the  service  criteria \\nthat  paratransit  systems  must  meet,  the \\nplanning  process  involved,  and  the  proce-\\ndures  for  applying  for  waivers  based  on \\nundue financial burden. \\n\\nParatransit  may  be  provided  by  a  variety \\nof modes. Publicly operated dial-a-ride vans, \\nservice  contracted  out  to  a  private  para-\\ntransit provider, user-side subsidy programs, \\nor  any  combination  of  these  and  other  ap-\\nproaches  is  acceptable.  Entities  who  feel  it \\nnecessary  to  apply  for  an  undue  financial \\nburden  waiver  should  be  aware  that  one  of \\nthe  factors  FTA  will  examine  in  evaluating \\nwaiver  requests  is  efficiencies  the  provider \\ncould  realize  in  its  paratransit  service. \\nTherefore, it is important for entities in this \\nsituation to use the most economical and ef-\\nficient  methods  of  providing  paratransit \\nthey can devise. \\n\\nIt  is  also  important  for  them  to  establish \\nand  consistently  implement  strong  controls \\nagainst  fraud,  waste  and  abuse  in  the  para-\\ntransit  system.  Fraud,  waste  and  abuse  can \\ndrain  significant  resources  from  a  system \\nand  control  of  these  problems  is  an  impor-\\ntant  ‘‘efficiency  for  any  paratransit  system. \\nIt  will  be  difficult  for  the  Department  to \\ngrant  an  undue  financial  burden  waiver  to \\nentities  which  do  not  have  a  good  means  of \\ndetermining  if  fraud,  waste  and  abuse  are \\nproblems  and  adequate  methods  of  com-\\nbating these problems, where they are found \\nto exist. \\n\\nSection 37.123 ADA Paratransit Eligibility— \\nStandards \\n\\nGeneral Provisions \\n\\nThis  section  sets  forth  the  minimum  re-\\nquirements for eligibility for complementary \\nparatransit service. All fixed route operators \\nproviding  complementary  paratransit  must \\nmake  service  available  at  least  to  individ-\\nuals meeting these standards. The ADA does \\nnot prohibit providing paratransit service to \\nanyone.  Entities  may  provide  service  to  ad-\\nditional  persons  as  well.  Since  only  service \\nto  ADA  eligible  persons  is  required  by  the \\nrule,  however,  only  the  costs  of  this  service \\ncan  be  counted  in  the  context  of  a  request \\nfor an undue financial burden waiver. \\n\\nWhen  the  rule  says  that  ADA  paratransit \\neligibility  shall  be  strictly  limited  to  per-\\nsons in the eligible categories, then, it is not \\nsaying  that  entities  are  in  any  way  pre-\\ncluded from serving other people. It is saying \\nthat the persons who must be provided serv-\\nice, and counting the costs of providing them \\nservice, in context of an undue burden waiv-\\ner,  are  limited  to  the  regulatory  categories. \\n\\n503 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00513 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cPt. 37, App. D \\n\\n49 CFR Subtitle A (10–1–21 Edition) \\n\\nTEMPORARY DISABILITIES \\n\\nEligibility may be based on a temporary as \\nwell  as  a  permanent  disability.  The  indi-\\nvidual must meet one of the three eligibility \\ncriteria in any case, but can do so for a lim-\\nited  period  of  time.  For  example,  if  an  indi-\\nvidual  breaks  both  legs  and  is  in  two  casts \\nfor several weeks, becomes a wheelchair user \\nfor  the  duration,  and  the  bus  route  that \\nwould  normally  take  him  to  work  is  not  ac-\\ncessible,  the  individual  could  be  eligible \\nunder  the  second  eligibility  category.  In \\ngranting eligibility to such a person, the en-\\ntity  should  establish  an  expiration  date  for \\neligibility  consistent  with  the  expected  end \\nof the period disability. \\n\\nTRIP-BY-TRIP ELIGIBILITY \\n\\nA  person  may  be  ADA  paratransit  eligible \\nfor  some  trips  but  not  others.  Eligibility \\ndoes  not  inhere  in  the  individual  or  his  or \\nher  disability,  as  such,  but  in  meeting  the \\nfunctional  criteria  of  inability  to  use  the \\nfixed  route  system  established  by  the  ADA. \\nThis  inability  is  likely  to  change  with  dif-\\nfering circumstances. \\n\\nFor  example,  someone  whose  impairment- \\nrelated  condition  is  a  severe  sensitivity  to \\ntemperatures  below  20  degrees  is  not  pre-\\nvented  from  using  fixed  route  transit  when \\nthe  temperature  is  75  degrees.  Someone \\nwhose impairment-related condition is an in-\\nability  to  maneuver  a  wheelchair  through \\nsnow is not prevented from using fixed route \\ntransit when there is no snow on the ground. \\nSomeone  with  a  cognitive  disability  may \\nhave  learned  to  take  the  same  bus  route  to \\na supported employment job every day. This \\nindividual is able to navigate the system for \\nwork purposes and therefore would not be el-\\nigible for paratransit for work trips. But the \\nindividual may be unable to get to other des-\\ntinations on the bus system without getting \\nlost, and would be eligible for paratransit for \\nnon-work  trips.  Someone  who  normally \\ndrives his own car to a rail system park and \\nride  lot  may  have  a  specific  impairment  re-\\nlated condition preventing him from getting \\nto the station when his car is in the shop. A \\nperson  who  can  use  accessible  fixed  route \\nservice  can  go  to  one  destination  on  an  ac-\\ncessible route; another destination would re-\\nquire  the  use  of  an  inaccessible  route.  The \\nindividual  would  be  eligible  for  the  latter \\nbut not the former. \\n\\nIn  many  cases,  though  the  person  is  eligi-\\nble  for  some  trips  but  not  others,  eligibility \\ndeterminations  would  not  have  to  be  made \\nliterally on a trip-by-trip basis. It may often \\nbe possible to establish the conditions on eli-\\ngibility  as  part  of  the  initial  eligibility  de-\\ntermination  process.  Someone  with  a  tem-\\nperature  sensitivity  might  be  granted  sea-\\nsonal  eligibility.  Somebody  who  is  able  to \\nnavigate  the  system  for  work  but  not  non- \\nwork  trips  could  have  this  fact  noted  in  his \\n\\nor  her  eligibility  documentation.  Likewise, \\nsomeone with a variable condition (e.g., mul-\\ntiple  sclerosis,  HIV  disease,  need  for  kidney \\ndialysis) could have their eligibility based on \\nthe  underlying  condition,  with  paratransit \\nneed  for  a  particular  trip  dependent  on  self- \\nassessment  or  a  set  of  medical  standards \\n(e.g.,  trip  within  a  certain  amount  of  time \\nafter  a  dialysis  session).  On  the  other  hand, \\npersons  in  the  second  eligibility  category \\n(people  who  can  use  accessible  fixed  route \\nservice  where  it  exists)  would  be  given  serv-\\nice  on  the  basis  of  the  particular  route  they \\nwould use for a given trip. \\n\\nBecause  entities  are  not  precluded  from \\nproviding  service  beyond  that  required  by \\nthe rule, an entity that believes it is too dif-\\nficult to administer a program of trip-by-trip \\neligibility  is  not  required  to  do  so.  Nothing \\nprevents  an  entity  from  providing  all  re-\\nquested  trips  to  a  person  whom  the  ADA  re-\\nquires to receive service for only some trips. \\nIn  this  case,  if  the  entity  intends  to  request \\nan undue financial burden waiver, the entity, \\nas provided in the undue burden provisions of \\nthis  rule,  must  estimate,  by  a  statistically \\nvalid  technique,  the  percentage  of  its  para-\\ntransit trips that are mandated by the ADA. \\nOnly  that  percentage  of  its  total  costs  will \\nbe  counted  in  considering  the  undue  burden \\nwaiver request. \\n\\nCATEGORY 1 ELIGIBILITY \\n\\nThe  first  eligibility  category  includes, \\namong others, persons with mental or visual \\nimpairments who, as a result, cannot ‘‘navi-\\ngate  the  system.’’  This  eligibility  category \\nincludes  people  who  cannot  board,  ride,  or \\ndisembark from an accessible vehicle ‘‘with-\\nout  the  assistance  of  another  individual.’’ \\nThis  means  that,  if  an  individual  needs  an \\nattendant  to  board,  ride,  or  disembark  from \\nan  accessible  fixed  route  vehicles  (including \\n‘‘navigating  the  system’’),  the  individual  is \\neligible  for  paratransit.  One  implication  of \\nthis  language  is  that  an  individual  does  not \\nlose paratransit eligibility based on ‘‘inabil-\\nity to navigate the system’’ because the indi-\\nvidual chooses to travel with a friend on the \\nparatransit  system  (even  if  the  friend  could \\nhelp the person navigate the fixed route sys-\\ntem). Eligibility in this category is based on \\nability  to  board,  ride,  and  disembark  inde-\\npendently. \\n\\nMobility  training  (e.g.,  of  persons  with \\nmental  or  visual  impairments)  may  help  to \\nimprove  the  ability  of  persons  to  navigate \\nthe system or to get to a bus stop. Someone \\nwho  is  successfully  mobility  trained  to  use \\nthe  fixed  route  system  for  all  or  some  trips \\nneed  not  be  provided  paratransit  service  for \\nthose  trips.  The  Department  encourages  en-\\ntities to sponsor such training as a means of \\nassisting individuals to use fixed route rath-\\ner than paratransit. \\n\\n504 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00514 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cOffice of the Secretary of Transportation \\n\\nPt. 37, App. D \\n\\nCATEGORY 2 ELIGIBILITY \\n\\nThe  second  eligibility  criterion  is  the \\nbroadest, with respect to persons with mobil-\\nity impairments, but its impact should be re-\\nduced  over  time  as  transit  systems  become \\nmore  accessible.  This  category  applies  to \\npersons  who  could  use  accessible  fixed  route \\ntransportation, but accessible transportation \\nis  not  being  used  at  the  time,  and  on  the \\nroute, the persons would travel. This concept \\nis route based, not system based. \\n\\nSpeaking first of bus systems, if a person is \\ntraveling  from  Point  A  to  Point  B  on  route \\n1, and route 1 is accessible, the person is not \\neligible  for  paratransit  for  the  trip.  This  is \\ntrue  even  though  other  portions  of  the  sys-\\ntem  are  still  inaccessible.  If  the  person  is \\ntraveling  from  Point  A  to  Point  C  on  route \\n2, which is not accessible, the person is eligi-\\nble  for  that  trip.  If  the  person  is  traveling \\nfrom Point A to Point B on accessible route \\n1,  with  a  transfer  at  B  to  go  on  inaccessible \\nroute 3 to Point D, then the person is eligible \\nfor  the  second  leg  of  the  trip.  (The  entity \\ncould  choose  to  provide  a  paratransit  trip \\nfrom  A  to  D  or  a  paratransit  or  on-call  bus \\ntrip from B to D.) \\n\\nFor  purposes  of  this  standard,  we  view  a \\nroute  as  accessible  when  all  buses  scheduled \\non  the  route  are  accessible.  Otherwise,  it  is \\nunlikely  that  an  accessible  vehicle  could  be \\nprovided  ‘‘within  a  reasonable  period  of  [a] \\ntime’’  when  the  individual  wants  to  travel, \\nas  the  provision  requires.  We  recognize  that \\nsome  systems’  operations  may  not  be  orga-\\nnized  in  a  way  that  permits  determining \\nwhether  a  given  route  is  accessible,  even \\nthough  a  route-by-route  determination  ap-\\npears  to  be  contemplated  by  the  statute.  In \\nsuch  cases,  it  may  be  that  category  2  eligi-\\nbility  would  persist  until  the  entire  system \\nwas eligible. \\n\\nWith  respect  to  a  rail  system,  an  indi-\\nvidual  is  eligible  under  this  standard  if,  on \\nthe  route  or  line  he  or  she  wants  to  use, \\nthere  is  not  yet  one  car  per  train  accessible \\nor if key stations are not yet accessible. This \\neligibility  remains  even  if  bus  systems  cov-\\nering the area served by the rail system have \\nbecome  100  percent  accessible.  This  is  nec-\\nessary  because  people  use  rail  systems  for \\ndifferent  kinds  of  trips  than  bus  systems.  It \\nwould  often  take  much  more  in  the  way  of \\ntime,  trouble,  and  transfers  for  a  person  to \\ngo  on  the  buses  of  one  or  more  transit  au-\\nthorities  than  to  have  a  direct  trip  provided \\nby the rail operator. Since bus route systems \\nare often designed to feed rail systems rather \\nthan  duplicate  them,  it  may  often  be  true \\nthat ‘‘you can’t get there from here’’ relying \\nentirely  on  bus  routes  or  the  paratransit \\nservice area that parallels them. \\n\\nIf  the  lift  on  a  vehicle  cannot  be  deployed \\nat a particular stop, an individual is eligible \\nfor  paratransit  under  this  category  with  re-\\nspect to the service to the inaccessible stop. \\n\\nIf  on  otherwise  accessible  route  1,  an  indi-\\nvidual wants to travel from Point A to Point \\nE,  and  the  lift  cannot  be  deployed  at  E,  the \\nindividual  is  eligible  for  paratransit  for  the \\ntrip.  (On-call  bus  would  not  work  as  a  mode \\nof providing this trip, since a bus lift will not \\ndeploy at the stop.) This is true even though \\nservice  from  Point  A  to  all  other  points  on \\nthe  line  is  fully  accessible.  In  this  cir-\\ncumstance, the entity should probably think \\nseriously  about  working  with  the  local  gov-\\nernment involved to have the stop moved or \\nmade accessible. \\n\\nWhen  we  say  that  a  lift  cannot  be  de-\\nployed,  we  mean  literally  that  the  mecha-\\nnism will not work at the location to permit \\na wheelchair user or other person with a dis-\\nability  to  disembark  or  that  the  lift  will  be \\ndamaged  if  it  is  used  there.  It  is  not  con-\\nsistent with the rule for a transit provider to \\ndeclare a stop off-limits to someone who uses \\nthe  lift  while  allowing  other  passengers  to \\nuse  the  stop.  However,  if  temporary  condi-\\ntions  not  under  the  operator’s  control  (e.g., \\nconstruction, an accident, a landslide) make \\nit so hazardous for anyone to disembark that \\nthe stop is temporarily out of service for all \\npassengers  may  the  operator  refuse  to  allow \\na passenger to disembark using the lift. \\n\\nCATEGORY 3 ELIGIBILITY \\n\\nThe  third  eligibility  criterion  concerns  in-\\ndividuals who have a specific impairment-re-\\nlated  condition  which  prevents  them  from \\ngetting to or from a stop or station. As noted \\nin the legislative history of the ADA, this is \\nintended to be a ‘‘very narrow exception’’ to \\nthe  general  rule  that  difficulty  in  traveling \\nto  or  from  boarding  or  disembarking  loca-\\ntions is not a basis for eligibility. \\n\\nWhat is a specific impairment-related con-\\ndition? The legislative history mentions four \\nexamples:  Chronic  fatigue,  blindness,  a  lack \\nof  cognitive  ability  to  remember  and  follow \\ndirections,  or  a  special  sensitivity  to  tem-\\nperature.  Impaired  mobility,  severe  commu-\\nnications  disabilities  (e.g.,  a  combination  of \\nserious  vision  and  hearing  impairments), \\ncardiopulmonary  conditions,  or  various \\nother  serious  health  problems  may  have \\nsimilar effects. The Department does not be-\\nlieve that it is appropriate, or even possible, \\nto create an exhaustive list. \\n\\nWhat  the  rule  uses  as  an  eligibility  cri-\\nterion  is  not  just  the  existence  of  a  specific \\nimpairment-related  condition.  To  be  a  basis \\nfor  eligibility,  the  condition  must  prevent \\nthe  individual  from  traveling  to  a  boarding \\nlocation  or  from  a  disembarking  location. \\nThe  word  ‘‘prevent’’  is  very  important.  For \\nanyone,  going  to  a  bus  stop  and  waiting  for \\na  bus  is  more  difficult  and  less  comfortable \\nthan  waiting  for  a  vehicle  at  one’s  home. \\nThis  is  likely  to  be  all  the  more  true  for  an \\nindividual  with  a  disability.  But  for  many \\npersons  with  disabilities,  in  many  cir-\\ncumstances, getting to a bus stop is possible. \\n\\n505 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00515 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cPt. 37, App. D \\n\\n49 CFR Subtitle A (10–1–21 Edition) \\n\\nIf  an  impairment  related  condition  only \\nmakes  the  job  of  accessing  transit  more  dif-\\nficult  than  it  might  otherwise  be,  but  does \\nnot prevent the travel, then the person is not \\neligible. \\n\\nFor example, in many areas, there are not \\nyet  curb  cuts.  A  wheelchair  user  can  often \\nget  around  this  problem  by  taking  a  less  di-\\nrect  route  to  a  destination  than  an  ambula-\\ntory  person  would  take.  That  involves  more \\ntime,  trouble,  and  effort  than  for  someone \\nwithout a mobility impairment. But the per-\\nson can still get to the bus stop. On the basis \\nof  these  architectural  barriers,  the  person \\nwould not be eligible. \\n\\nEntities are cautioned that, particularly in \\ncases  involving  lack  of  curb  cuts  and  other \\narchitectural  barrier  problems,  assertions  of \\neligibility  should  be  given  tight  scrutiny. \\nOnly if it is apparent from the facts of a par-\\nticular case that an individual cannot find a \\nreasonable  alternative  path  to  a  location \\nshould eligibility be granted. \\n\\nIf  we  add  a  foot  of  snow  to  the  scenario, \\nthen the same person taking the same route \\nmay  be  unable  to  get  to  the  bus  stop.  It  is \\nnot  the  snow  alone  that  stops  him;  it  is  the \\ninteraction of the snow and the fact that the \\nindividual  has  a  specific-impairment  related \\ncondition that requires him to push a wheel-\\nchair  through  the  snow  that  prevents  the \\ntravel. \\n\\nInevitably,  some  judgment  is  required  to \\ndistinguish  between  situations  in  which \\ntravel is prevented and situations in which it \\nis merely made more difficult. In the Depart-\\nment’s  view,  a  case  of  ‘‘prevented  travel’’ \\ncan  be  made  not  only  where  travel  is  lit-\\nerally  impossible  (e.g.,  someone  cannot  find \\nthe  bus  stop,  someone  cannot  push  a  wheel-\\nchair through the foot of snow or up a steep \\nhill)  but  also  where  the  difficulties  are  so \\nsubstantial  that  a  reasonable  person  with \\nthe  impairment-related  condition  in  ques-\\ntion would be deterred from making the trip. \\nThe  regulation  makes  the  interaction  be-\\ntween  an  impairment-related  condition  and \\nthe environmental barrier (whether distance, \\nweather,  terrain,  or  architectural  barriers) \\nthe key to eligibility determinations. This is \\nan  individual  determination.  Depending  on \\nthe  specifics  of  their  impairment-related \\ncondition, one individual may be able to get \\nfrom  his  home  to  a  bus  stop  under  a  given \\nset  of  conditions,  while  his  next-door  neigh-\\nbor may not. \\n\\nCOMPANIONS \\n\\nThe ADA requires entities to provide para-\\ntransit  to  one  person  accompanying  the  eli-\\ngible  individual,  with  others  served  on  a \\nspace-available  basis.  The  one  individual \\nwho  is  guaranteed  space  on  the  vehicle  can \\nbe  anyone—family  member,  business  asso-\\nciate,  friend,  date,  etc.  The  provider  cannot \\nlimit  the  eligible  individual’s  choice  of  type \\nof companion. The transit authority may re-\\n\\nquire  that  the  eligible  individual  reserve  a \\nspace for the companion when the individual \\nreserves  his  or  her  own  ride.  This  one  indi-\\nvidual  rides  even  if  this  means  that  there  is \\nless  room  for  other  eligible  individuals.  Ad-\\nditional  individuals  beyond  the  first  com-\\npanion  are  carried  only  on  a  space  available \\nbasis;  that  is,  they  do  not  displace  other \\nADA paratransit eligible individuals. \\n\\nA  personal  care  attendant  (i.e.,  someone \\ndesignated  or  employed  specifically  to  help \\nthe  eligible  individual  meet  his  or  her  per-\\nsonal needs) always may ride with the eligi-\\nble individual. If there is a personal care at-\\ntendant  on  the  trip,  the  eligible  individual \\nmay still bring a companion, plus additional \\ncompanions  on  a  space  available  basis.  The \\nentity  may  require  that,  in  reserving  the \\ntrip, the eligible individual reserve the space \\nfor the attendant. \\n\\nTo  prevent  potential  abuse  of  this  provi-\\nsion,  the  rule  provides  that  a  companion \\n(e.g.,  friend  or  family  member)  does  not \\ncount  as  a  personal  care  attendant  unless \\nthe  eligible  individual  regularly  makes  use \\nof  a  personal  care  attendant  and  the  com-\\npanion  is  actually  acting  in  that  capacity. \\nAs  noted  under  § 37.125,  a  provider  may  re-\\nquire  that,  as  part  of  the  initial  eligibility \\ncertification  process,  an  individual  indicate \\nwhether  he  or  she  travels  with  a  personal \\ncare attendant. If someone does not indicate \\nthe use of an attendant, then any individual \\naccompanying  him or her  would be regarded \\nsimply as a companion. \\n\\nindividual. \\n\\nTo be viewed as ‘‘accompanying’’ the eligi-\\nble  individual,  a  companion  must  have  the \\nsame origin and destination points as the eli-\\ngible \\ncir-\\nIn \\ncumstances,  entities  may  also  wish  to  pro-\\nvide  service  to  a  companion  who  has  either \\nan  origin  or  destination,  but  not  both,  with \\nthe  eligible  individual  (e.g.,  the  individual’s \\ndate  is  dropped  off  at  her  own  residence  on \\nthe return trip from a concert). \\n\\nappropriate \\n\\nSection 37.125 ADA Paratransit Eligibility— \\nProcess \\n\\nThis  section  requires  an  eligibilty  process \\nto  be  established  by  each  operator  of  com-\\nplementary  paratransit.

What  is  needed  is  a  determina-\\ntion  of  whether,  as  a  practical  matter,  the \\nindividual  can  use  fixed  route  transit  in  his \\nor  her  own  circumstances.  That  is  a  trans-\\nportation  decision  primarily,  not  a  medical \\ndecision. \\n\\nThe  goal  of  the  process  is  to  ensure  that \\nonly  people  who  meet  the  regulatory  cri-\\nteria,  strictly  applied,  are  regarded  as  ADA \\nparatransit  eligible.  The  Department  recog-\\nnizes  that  transit  entities  may  wish  to  pro-\\nvide  service  to  other  persons,  which  is  not \\nprohibited  by  this  rule.  However,  the  eligi-\\nbility  process  should  clearly  distinguish \\nthose  persons  who  are  ADA  eligible  from \\nthose  who  are  provided  service  on  other \\ngrounds. For example, eligibility documenta-\\ntion  must  clearly  state  whether  someone  is \\nADA paratransit eligible or eligible on some \\nother basis. \\n\\nOften,  people  tend  to  think  of  paratransit \\nexclusively in terms of people with mobility \\nimpairments. Under the ADA, this is not ac-\\ncurate.  Persons  with  visual  impairments \\nmay  be  eligible  under  either  the  first  or \\nthird eligibility categories. To accommodate \\nthem,  all  documents  concerning  eligibility \\nmust  be  made  available  in  one  or  more  ac-\\ncessible  formats,  on  request.  Accessible  for-\\nmats  include  computer  disks,  braille  docu-\\nments, audio cassettes, and large print docu-\\nments. A document does not necessarily need \\nto  be  made  available  in  the  format  a  re-\\nquester  prefers,  but  it  does  have  to  be  made \\navailable  in  a  format  the  person  can  use. \\nThere  is  no  use  giving  a  computer  disk  to \\nsomeone  who  does  not  have  a  computer,  for \\ninstance,  or  a  braille  document  to  a  person \\nwho does not read braille. \\n\\nWhen  a  person  applies  for  eligibility,  the \\nentity  will  provide  all  the  needed  forms  and \\ninstructions.  These  forms  and  instructions \\nmay include a declaration of whether the in-\\ndividual travels with a personal care attend-\\nant.  The  entity  may  make  further  inquiries \\nconcerning  such  a  declaration  (e.g.,  with  re-\\nspect  to  the  individual’s  actual  need  for  a \\npersonal care attendant). \\n\\nWhen the application process is complete— \\nall  necessary  actions  by  the  applicant \\ntaken—the entity should process the applica-\\ntion  in  21  days.  If  it  is  unable  to  do  so,  it \\nmust  begin  to  provide  service  to  the  appli-\\ncant  on  the  22nd  day,  as  if  the  application \\nhad  been  granted.  Service  may  be  termi-\\nnated only if and when the entity denies the \\napplication.  All  determinations  shall  be  in \\nwriting; in the case of a denial, reasons must \\nbe  specified.  The  reasons  must  specifically \\nrelate  the  evidence  in  the  matter  to  the  eli-\\ngibility  criteria  of  this  rule  and  of  the  enti-\\nty’s  process.  A  mere  recital  that  the  appli-\\ncant  can  use  fixed  route  transit  is  not  suffi-\\ncient. \\n\\nFor  people  granted  eligibility,  the  docu-\\nmentation of eligibility shall include at least \\nthe following information: \\n—The individual’s name \\n—The name of the transit provider \\n—The telephone number of the entity’s para-\\n\\ntransit coordinator \\n\\n—An expiration date for eligibility \\n—Any  conditions  or  limitations  on  the  indi-\\nvidual’s  eligibility,  including  the  use  of  a \\npersonal care attendant. \\nThe  last  point  refers  to  the  situation  in \\nwhich  a  person  is  eligible  for  some  trips  but \\nnot others. Or if the traveler is authorized to \\nhave  a  personal  care  attendant  ride  free  of \\ncharge.  For  example,  the  documentation \\nmay  say  that  the  individual  is  eligible  only \\nwhen  the  temperature  falls  below  a  certain \\npoint,  or  when  the  individual  is  going  to  a \\ndestination  not  on  an  accessible  bus  route, \\nor for non-work trips, etc. \\n\\nAs  the  mention  of  an  expiration  date  im-\\nplies, certification is not forever. The entity \\nmay recertify eligibility at reasonable inter-\\nvals  to  make  sure  that  changed  cir-\\ncumstances  have  not  invalidated  or  changed \\nthe  individual’s  eligibility.  In  the  Depart-\\nment’s view, a reasonable interval for recer-\\ntification is probably between one and three \\nyears. Less than one year would probably be \\ntoo  burdensome  for  consumers;  over  three \\nyears  would  begin  to  lose  the  point  of  doing \\nrecertifications.  The  recertification  interval \\nshould  be  stated  in  the  entity’s  plan.  Of \\ncourse,  a  user  of  the  service  can  apply  to \\nmodify conditions on his or her eligibility at \\nany time. \\n\\nThe  administrative  appeal  process  is  in-\\ntended  to  give  applicants  who  have  been  de-\\nnied eligibility the opportunity to have their \\ncases  heard  by  some  official  other  than  the \\none who turned them down in the first place. \\nIn  order  to  have  appropriate  separation  of \\nfunctions—a  key  element  of  administrative \\ndue  process—not  only  must  the  same  person \\nnot  decide  the  case  on  appeal,  but  that  per-\\nson,  to  the  extent  practicable,  should  not \\nhave been involved in the first decision (e.g., \\nas  a  member  of  the  same  office,  or  a  super-\\nvisor or subordinate of the original decision-\\nmaker). When, as in the case of a small tran-\\nsit operator, this degree of separation is not \\nfeasible, the second decisionmaker should at \\nleast be ‘‘bubbled’’ with respect to the origi-\\nnal  decision  (i.e.,  not  have  participated  in \\nthe original decision or discussed it with the \\noriginal  decisionmaker).  In  addition,  there \\nmust be an opportunity to be heard in person \\nas well as the chance to present written evi-\\ndence  and  arguments.

The purpose of this process would be to \\ndeter  or  deal  with  chronic  ‘‘no-shows.’’  The \\nsanction system—articulated criteria for the \\nimposition of sanctions, length of suspension \\nperiods,  details  of  the  administrative  proc-\\ness,  etc.—would  be  developed  through  the \\npublic planning and participation process for \\nthe  entity’s  paratransit  plan,  and  the  result \\nreflected in the plan submission to FTA. \\n\\nIt is very important to note that sanctions \\ncould be imposed only for a ‘‘pattern or prac-\\ntice’’  of  missed  trips.  A  pattern  or  practice \\ninvolves  intentional,  repeated  or  regular  ac-\\ntions,  not  isolated,  accidental,  or  singular \\nincidents. Moreover, only actions within the \\ncontrol  of  the  individual  count  as  part  of  a \\npattern or practice. Missed trips due to oper-\\nator  error  are  not  attributable  to  the  indi-\\nvidual passenger for this purpose. If the vehi-\\ncle  arrives  substantially  after  the  scheduled \\npickup time, and the passenger has given up \\non the vehicle and taken a taxi or gone down \\nthe  street  to  talk  to  a  neighbor,  that  is  not \\na  missed  trip  attributable  to  the  passenger. \\nIf the vehicle does not arrive at all, or is sent \\nto  the  wrong  address,  or  to  the  wrong  en-\\ntrance to a building, that is not a missed trip \\nattributable  to  the  passenger.  There  may  be \\nother  circumstances  beyond  the  individual’s \\ncontrol  (e.g.,  a  sudden  turn  for  the  worse  in \\nsomeone with a variable condition, a sudden \\nfamily  emergency)  that  make  it  impracti-\\ncable  for  the  individual  to  travel  at  the \\nscheduled time and also for the individual to \\nnotify  the  entity  in  time  to  cancel  the  trip \\nbefore \\nthe  vehicle  comes.  Such  cir-\\ncumstances  also  would  not  form  part  of  a \\nsanctionable pattern or practice. \\n\\nOnce an entity has certified someone as el-\\nigible,  the  individual’s  eligibility  takes  on \\nthe  coloration  of  a  property  right.  (This  is \\nnot  merely  a  theoretical  statement.  If  one \\ndepends  on  transportation  one  has  been \\nfound eligible for to get to a job, and the eli-\\n\\ngibility  is  removed,  one  may  lose  the  job. \\nThe  same  can  be  said  for  access  to  medical \\ncare  or  other  important  services.)  Con-\\nsequently, before eligibility may be removed \\n‘‘for  cause’’  under  this  provision,  the  entity \\nmust  provide  administrative  due  process  to \\nthe individual. \\n\\nIf  the  entity  proposes  to  impose  sanctions \\non  someone,  it  must  first  notify  the  indi-\\nvidual  in  writing  (using  accessible  formats \\nwhere  necessary).  The  notice  must  specify \\nthe  basis  of  the  proposed  action  (e.g.,  Mr. \\nSmith  scheduled  trips  for  8  a.m.  on  May  15, \\n2  p.m.  on  June  3,  9  a.m.  on  June  21,  and  9:20 \\np.m. on July 10, and on each occasion the ve-\\nhicle appeared at the scheduled time and Mr. \\nSmith  was  nowhere  to  be  found)  and  set \\nforth  the  proposed  sanction  (e.g.,  Mr.  Smith \\nwould not receive service for 15 days). \\n\\nThe entity would provide the individual an \\nopportunity to be heard (i.e., an in-person in-\\nformal  hearing  before  a  decisionmaker)  as \\nwell  as  to  present  written  and  oral  informa-\\ntion  and  arguments.  All  relevant  entity \\nrecords  and  personnel  would  be  made  avail-\\nable  to  the  individual,  and  other  persons \\ncould  testify.  It  is  likely  that,  in  many \\ncases,  an  important  factual  issue  would  be \\nwhether a missed trip was the responsibility \\nof the provider or the passenger, and the tes-\\ntimony  of  other  persons  and  the  provider’s \\nrecords or personnel are likely to be relevant \\nin  deciding  this  issue.  While  the  hearing  is \\nintended to be informal, the individual could \\nbring a representative (e.g., someone from an \\nadvocacy organization, an attorney). \\n\\nThe  individual  may  waive  the  hearing  and \\nproceed  on  the  basis  of  written  presen-\\ntations. If the individual does not respond to \\nthe  notice  within  a  reasonable  time,  the  en-\\ntity  may  make,  in  effect,  a  default  finding \\nand  impose  sanctions.  If  there  is  a  hearing, \\nand  the  individual  needs  paratransit  service \\nto  attend  the  hearing,  the  entity  must  pro-\\nvide  it.  We  would  emphasize  that,  prior  to  a \\nfinding  against  the  individual  after  this  due \\nprocess  procedure,  the  individual  must  con-\\ntinue  to  receive  service.  The  entity  cannot \\nsuspend service while the matter is pending. \\nThe  entity  must  notify  the  individual  in \\nwriting  about  the  decision,  the  reasons  for \\nit, and the sanctions imposed, if any. Again, \\nthis information would be made available in \\naccessible  formats.  In  the  case  of  a  decision \\nadverse to the individual, the administrative \\nappeals  process  of  this  section  would  apply. \\nThe sanction would be stayed pending an ap-\\npeal. \\n\\nThere  are  means  other  than  sanctions, \\nhowever,  by  which  a  transit  provider  can \\ndeal with a ‘‘no-show’’ problem in its system. \\nProviders who use ‘‘real time scheduling’’ re-\\nport  that  this  technique  is  very  effective  in \\nreducing no-shows and cancellations, and in-\\ncreasing the mix of real time scheduling in a \\nsystem  can  probably  be  of  benefit  in  this \\narea.

By  ‘‘on  the  same  basis,’’  we  mean \\nunder  all  the  same  conditions,  service  cri-\\nteria,  etc.,  without  distinction.  For  the  pe-\\nriod  of  a  visit,  the  visitor  is  treated  exactly \\nlike an eligible local user, without any high-\\ner priority being given to either. \\n\\nA  visitor  is  defined  as  someone  who  does \\nnot reside in the jurisdiction or jurisdictions \\nserved  by  the  public  entity  or  other  public \\nentities  with  which  it  coordinates  para-\\ntransit  service.  For  example,  suppose  a  five- \\ncounty  metropolitan  area  provides  coordi-\\nnated paratransit service under a joint plan. \\nA  resident  of  any  of  the  five  counties  would \\nnot  be  regarded  as  a  visitor  in  any  of  them. \\nNote  that  the  rule  talks  in  terms  of  ‘‘juris-\\ndiction’’ rather than ‘‘service area.’’ If an in-\\ndividual  lives  in  XYZ  County,  but  outside \\nthe  fixed  route  service  area  of  that  county’s \\ntransit provider, the individual is still not a \\nvisitor  for  purposes  of  paratransit  in  PQR \\nCounty,  if  PQR  is  one  of  the  counties  with \\nwhich  XYZ  provides  coordinated  paratransit \\nservice. \\n\\nA visitor can become eligible in one of two \\nways.  The  first  is  to  present  documentation \\nfrom  his  or  her  ‘‘home’’  jurisdiction’s  para-\\ntransit  system.  The  local  provider  will  give \\n‘‘full  faith  and  credit’’  to  the  ID  card  or \\nother  documentation  from  the  other  entity. \\nIf the individual has no such documentation, \\nthe local provider may require the provision \\nof  proof  of  visitor  status  (i.e.,  proof  of  resi-\\ndence  somewhere  else)  and,  if  the  individ-\\nual’s  disability  is  not  apparent,  proof  of  the \\ndisability  (e.g.,  a  letter  from  a  doctor  or  re-\\nhabilitation  professional).  Once  this  docu-\\nmentation  is  presented  and  is  satisfactory, \\nthe  local  provider  will  make  service  avail-\\nable  on  the  basis  of  the  individual’s  state-\\nment that he or she is unable to use the fixed \\nroute transit system. \\n\\nThe  local  provider  need  serve  someone \\nbased  on visitor  eligibility  for no more than \\n21 days. After that, the individual is treated \\nthe same as a local person for eligibility pur-\\nposes.  This  is  true  whether  the  21  days  are \\nconsecutive  or  parceled  out  over  several \\nshorter  visits.  The  local  provider  may  re-\\nquire the erstwhile visitor to apply for eligi-\\nbility  in  the  usual  local  manner.  A  visitor \\nwho expects to be around longer than 21 days \\nshould apply for regular eligibility as soon as \\nhe  arrives.  The  same  approach  may  be  used \\n\\nfor  a  service  of  requested  visits  totaling  21 \\ndays or more in a relating compact period of \\ntime.  Preferably,  this  application  process \\nshould be arranged before the visitor arrives, \\nby  letter,  telephone  or  fax,  so  that  a  com-\\nplete  application  can  be  processed  expedi-\\ntiously. \\n\\nSection 37.129 Types of Service \\n\\nThe  basic  mode  of  service  for  complemen-\\ntary  paratransit  is  demand  responsive,  ori-\\ngin-to-destination  service.  This  service  may \\nbe  provided  for  persons  in  any  one  of  the \\nthree eligibility categories, and must always \\nbe  provided  to  persons  in  the  first  category \\n(e.g.,  people  who  cannot  navigate  the  sys-\\ntem).  The  local  planning  process  should  de-\\ncide whether, or in what circumstances, this \\nservice  is  to  be  provided  as  door-to-door  or \\ncurb-to-curb service. \\n\\nFor  persons  in  the  second  eligibility  cat-\\negory  (e.g.,  persons  who  can  use  accessible \\nbuses,  but  do  not  have  an  accessible  bus \\nroute  available  to  take  them  to  their  des-\\ntination),  origin-to-destination  service  can \\nbe  used.  Alternatively,  the  entity  can  pro-\\nvide either of two other forms of service. One \\nis  on-call  bus,  in  which  the  individual  calls \\nthe provider and arranges for one or more ac-\\ncessible  buses  to  arrive  on  the  routes  he \\nneeds to use at the appropriate time. On-call \\nbus service must meet all the service criteria \\nof § 37.131, except that on-call buses run only \\non  fixed  routes  and  the  fare  charged  can  be \\nonly the fixed route fare that anyone pays on \\nthe bus (including discounts). \\n\\nThe  second  option  is  ‘‘feeder  paratransit’’ \\nto  an  accessible  fixed  route  that  will  take \\nthe  individual  to  his  or  her  destination. \\nFeeder  paratransit,  again,  would  have  to \\nmeet all the criteria of § 37.131. With respect \\nto  fares,  the  paratransit  fare  could  be \\ncharged,  but  the  individual  would  not  be \\ndouble  charged  for  the  trip.  That  is,  having \\npaid the paratransit fare, the transfer to the \\nfixed route would be free. \\n\\nFor  persons  in  the  third  eligibility  cat-\\negory  (e.g.,  persons  who  can  use  fixed  route \\ntransit but who, because of a specific impair-\\nment-related  condition,  cannot  get  to  or \\nfrom  a  stop),  the  ‘‘feeder  paratransit’’  op-\\ntion, under the conditions outlined above, is \\navailable.  For  some  trips,  it  might  be  nec-\\nessary  to  arrange  for  feeder  service  at  both \\nends  of  the  fixed  route  trip.  Given  the  more \\ncomplicated  logistics  of  such  arrangements, \\nand  the  potential  for  a  mistake  that  would \\nseriously  inconvenience  the  passenger,  the \\ntransit  provider  should  consider  carefully \\nwhether  such  a  ‘‘double  feeder’’  system, \\nwhile  permissible,  is  truly  workable  in  its \\nsystem (as opposed to a simpler system that \\nused  feeder  service  only  at  one  end  of  a  trip \\nwhen  the  bus  let  the  person  off  at  a  place \\nfrom  which  he  or  she  could  independently \\nget  to  the  destination).

At  the  end  of  a  route, \\nthere  is  a  semicircular  ‘‘cap’’  on  the  cor-\\nridor,  consisting  of  a  three-quarter  mile  ra-\\ndius  from  the  end  point  of  the  route  to  the \\nparallel sides of the corridor. \\n\\nComplementary  paratransit  must  provide \\nservice  to  any  origin  or  destination  point \\nwithin  a  corridor  fitting  this  description \\naround  any  route  in  the  bus  system.  Note \\nthat  this  does  not  say  that  an  eligible  user \\nmust live within a corridor in order to be eli-\\ngible.  If  an  individual  lives  outside  the  cor-\\nridor,  and  can  find  a  way  of  getting  to  a \\npickup point within the corridor, the service \\nmust pick him up there. The same holds true \\nat the destination end of the trip. \\n\\nAnother  concept  involved  in  this  service \\ncriterion  is  the  core  service  area.  Imagine  a \\nbus  route  map  of  a  typical  city.  Color  the \\nbus  routes  and  their  corridors  blue,  against \\nthe  white  outline  map.  In  the  densely  popu-\\nlated  areas  of  the  city,  the  routes  (which, \\nwith  their  corridors  attached,  cut  11⁄2 mile \\nswaths)  merge  together  into  a  solid  blue \\nmass.  There  are  few,  if  any,  white  spots  left \\nuncovered,  and  they  are  likely  to  be  very \\nsmall.  Paratransit  would  serve  all  origins \\nand destinations in the solid blue mass. \\n\\nBut  what  of  the  little  white  spots  sur-\\nrounded by various bus corridors? Because it \\nwould make sense to avoid providing service \\nto  such  small  isolated  areas,  the  rule  re-\\nquires  paratransit  service  there  as  well.  So \\ncolor them in too. \\n\\nOutside  the  core  area,  though,  as  bus \\nroutes follow radial arteries into the suburbs \\nand exurbs (we know real bus route maps are \\nmore complicated than this, but we simplify \\nfor  purposes  of  illustration),  there  are  in-\\ncreasingly wide white areas between the blue \\ncorridors,  which  may  have  corridors  on  ei-\\nther  side  of  them  but  are  not  small  areas \\ncompletely  surrounded  by  corridors.  These \\nwhite  spaces  are  not  part  of  the  paratransit \\n\\nservice area and the entity does not have to \\nserve  origins  and  destinations  there.  How-\\never,  if,  through  the  planning  process,  the \\nentity  wants  to  enlarge  the  width  of  one  or \\nmore  of  the  blue  corridors  from  the  3⁄4 of  a \\nmile width, it can do so, to a maximum of 11⁄2 \\nmiles  on  each  side  of  a  route.  The  cost  of \\nservice  provided  within  such  an  expanded \\ncorridor  can  be  counted  in  connection  with \\nan undue financial burden waiver request. \\n\\nThere  may  be  a  part  of  the  service  area \\nwhere part of one of the corridors overlaps a \\npolitical  boundary,  resulting  in  a  require-\\nment  to  serve  origins  and  destinations  in  a \\nneighboring  jurisdiction  which  the  entity \\nlacks  legal  authority  to  service.  The  entity \\nis not required to serve such origins and des-\\ntinations, even though the area on the other \\nside of the political boundary is within a cor-\\nridor. This exception to the service area cri-\\nterion  does  not  automatically  apply  when-\\never there is a political boundary, only when \\nthere  is  a  legal  bar  to  the  entity  providing \\nservice on the other side of the boundary. \\n\\nThe  rule  requires,  in  this  situation,  that \\nthe  entity  take  all  practicable  steps  to  get \\naround  the  problem  so  that  it  can  provide \\nservice throughout its service area. The enti-\\nty  should  work  with  the  state  or  local  gov-\\nernments  involved,  via  coordination  plans, \\nreciprocity  agreements,  memoranda  of  un-\\nderstanding or other means to prevent polit-\\nical  boundaries  from  becoming  barriers  to \\nthe travel of individuals with disabilities. \\n\\nThe  definition  of  the  service  area  for  rail \\nsystems is somewhat different, though many \\nof the same concepts apply. \\n\\n510 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00520 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\n/\\n\\n>\\nH\\nP\\nG\\n<\\n1\\n9\\n1\\n.\\n1\\n9\\nE\\nF\\n2\\n0\\nC\\nE\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cOffice of the Secretary of Transportation \\n\\nPt. 37, App. D \\n\\nAround  each  station  on  the  line  (whether \\nor not a key station), the entity would draw \\na circle with a radius of 3⁄4 mile. Some circles \\nmay touch or overlap. The series of circles is \\nthe rail system’s service area. (We recognize \\nthat, in systems where stations are close to-\\ngether,  this  could  result  in  a  service  area \\nthat approached being a corridor like that of \\na  bus  line.)  The  rail  system  would  provide \\nparatransit  service  from  any  point  in  one \\ncircle  to  any  point  in  any  other  circle.  The \\nentity  would  not  have  to  provide  service  to \\ntwo  points  within  the  same  circle,  since  a \\ntrip between two points in the vicinity of the \\nsame  station  is  not  a  trip  that  typically \\nwould be taken by train. Nor would the enti-\\nty have to provide service to spaces between \\nthe  circles.  For  example,  a  train  trip  would \\nnot  get  close  to  point  x;  one  would  have  to \\ntake  a  bus  or  other  mode  of  transportation \\nto get from station E or F to point x. A para-\\ntransit system comparable to the rail service \\narea  would  not  be  required  to  take  someone \\nthere either. \\n\\nRail  systems  typically  provide  trips  that \\nare  not  made,  or  cannot  be  made  conven-\\niently,  on  bus  systems.  For  example,  many \\nrail  systems  cross  jurisdictional  boundaries \\nthat bus systems often do not. One can trav-\\nel from Station A to a relatively distant Sta-\\ntion E on a rail system in a single trip, while \\na  bus  trip  between  the  same  points,  if  pos-\\nsible at all, may involve a number of indirect \\nroutings  and  transfers,  on  two  bus  systems \\nthat may not interface especially well. \\n\\nRail  operators  have  an  obligation  to  pro-\\nvide paratransit equivalents of trips between \\ncircles to persons who cannot use fixed route \\nrail  systems  because  they  cannot  navigate \\nthe  system,  because  key  stations  or  trains \\n\\nare  not  yet  accessible,  or  because  they  can-\\nnot  access  stations  from  points  within  the \\ncircles  because  of  a  specific  impairment-re-\\nlated  condition.  For  individuals  who  are  eli-\\ngible  in  category  2  because  they  need  an  ac-\\ncessible  key  station  to  use  the  system,  the \\nparatransit obligation extends only to trans-\\nportation  among  ‘‘circles’’  centered  on  des-\\nignated  key  stations  (since,  even  when  the \\nkey station plan is fully implemented, these \\nindividuals  will  be  unable  to  use  non-key \\nstations). \\n\\nIt  is  not  sufficient  for  a  rail  operator  to \\nrefer  persons  with  disabilities  to  an  acces-\\nsible  bus  system  in  the  area.  The  obligation \\nto  provide  paratransit  for  a  rail  system  is \\nindependent of the operations of any bus sys-\\ntem serving the same area, whether operated \\nby  the  same  entity  that  operates  the  rail \\nsystem  or  a  different  entity.  Obviously,  it \\nwill  be  advantageous  for  bus  and  rail  sys-\\ntems  to  coordinate  their  paratransit  efforts, \\nbut  a  coordinated  system  would  have  to  en-\\nsure  coverage  of  trips  comparable  to  rail \\ntrips  that  could  not  conveniently  be  taken \\non the fixed route bus system. \\n\\nRESPONSE TIME \\n\\nUnder this provision, an entity must make \\nits  reservation  service  available  during  the \\nhours  its  administrative  offices  are  open.  If \\nthose  offices  are  open  9  to  5,  those  are  the \\nhours  during  which  the  reservations  service \\nmust  be  open,  even  if  the  entity’s  transit \\nservice operated 6 a.m. to midnight. On days \\nprior to a service day on which the adminis-\\ntrative  offices  are  not  open  at  all  (e.g.,  a \\nSunday  prior  to  a  Monday  service  day),  the \\nreservation service would also be open 9 to 5. \\nNote that the reservation service on any day \\n\\n511 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00521 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\n/\\n\\n>\\nH\\nP\\nG\\n<\\n2\\n9\\n1\\n.\\n1\\n9\\nE\\nF\\n2\\n0\\nC\\nE\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cPt. 37, App. D \\n\\n49 CFR Subtitle A (10–1–21 Edition) \\n\\ndoes  not  have  to  be  provided  directly  by  a \\n‘‘real  person.’’  An  answering  machine  or \\nother technology can suffice. \\n\\nAny caller reaching the reservation service \\nduring  the  9  to  5  period,  in  this  example, \\ncould reserve service for any time during the \\nnext  6  a.m.  to  12  midnight  service  day.  This \\nis  the  difference  between  ‘‘next  day  sched-\\nuling’’  and  a  system  involving  a  24-hour \\nprior  reservation  requirement,  in  which  a \\ncaller  would  have  to  reserve  a  trip  at  7  a.m. \\ntoday if he or she wanted to travel at 7 a.m. \\ntomorrow.  The  latter  approach  is  not  ade-\\nquate under this rule. \\n\\nThe  entity  may  use  real  time  scheduling \\nfor all or part of its service. Like the Moliere \\ncharacter  who  spoke  prose  all  his  life  with-\\nout  knowing  it,  many  entities  may  already \\nbe using  some  real  time  scheduling  (e.g., for \\nreturn  trips  which  are  scheduled  on  a  when- \\nneeded  basis,  as  opposed  to  in  advance).  A \\nnumber  of  transit  providers  who  have  used \\nreal  time  scheduling  believe  that  it  is  more \\nefficient on a per-trip basis and reduces can-\\ncellations and no-shows significantly. We en-\\ncourage  entities  to  consider  this  form  of \\nservice. \\n\\nSometimes  users  want  to  schedule  service \\nwell in advance, to be sure of traveling when \\nthey want to. The rule tells providers to per-\\nmit  reservations  to  be  made  as  much  as  14 \\ndays in advance. In addition, though an enti-\\nty may negotiate with a user to adjust pick-\\nup and return trip times to make scheduling \\nmore  efficient,  the  entity  cannot  insist  on \\nscheduling a trip more than one hour earlier \\nor later than the individual desires to travel. \\nAny  greater  deviation  from  desired  trip \\nwould exceed the bounds of comparability. \\n\\nFARES \\n\\nTo  calculate  the  proper  paratransit  fare, \\nthe entity would determine the route(s) that \\nan  individual  would  take  to  get  from  his  or \\nher  origin  to  his  or  her  destination  on  the \\nfixed  route  system.  At  the  time  of  day  the \\nperson  was  traveling,  what  is  the  fare  for \\nthat trip on those routes? Applicable charges \\nlike transfer fees or premium service charges \\nmay  be  added  to  the  amount,  but  discounts \\n(e.g., the half-fare discount for off-peak fixed \\nroute travel by elderly and handicapped per-\\nsons)  would  not  be  subtracted.  The  transit \\nprovider could charge up to twice the result-\\ning amount for the paratransit trip. \\n\\nThe  mode  through  which  paratransit  is \\nprovided  does  not  change the method of cal-\\nculation.  For  example,  if  paratransit  is  pro-\\nvided via user side subsidy taxi service rath-\\ner  than  publicly  operated  dial-a-ride  van \\nservice,  the  cost  to  the  user  could  still  be \\nonly  twice  the  applicable  fixed  route  fare. \\nThe  system  operates  the  same  regardless  of \\nwhether  the  paratransit  trip  is  being  pro-\\nvided in place of a bus or a rail trip the user \\ncannot  make  on  the  fixed  route  system. \\nWhere  bus  and  rail  systems  are  run  by  the \\n\\nsame  provider  (or  where  the  same  bus  pro-\\nvider  runs  parallel  local  and  express  buses \\nalong the same route), the comparison would \\nbe made to the mode on which a typical fixed \\nroute  user  would  make  the  particular  trip, \\nbased  on  schedule,  length,  convenience, \\navoidance of transfers, etc. \\n\\nCompanions  are  charged  the  same  fare  as \\nthe  eligible  individual  they  are  accom-\\npanying.  Personal  care  attendants  ride  free. \\nOne  exception  to  the  fare  requirement  is \\nmade  for  social  service  agency  (or  other  or-\\nganization-sponsored)  trips.  This  exception, \\nwhich  allows  the  transit  provider  to  nego-\\ntiate  a  price  with  the  agency  that  is  more \\nthan  twice  the  relevant  fixed  route  fare,  ap-\\nplies  to  ‘‘agency  trips,’’  by  which  we  mean \\ntrips which are guaranteed to the agency for \\nits  use.  That  is,  if  an  agency  wants  12  slots \\nfor a trip to the mall on Saturday for clients \\nwith  disabilities,  the  agency  makes  the  res-\\nervation for the trips in its name, the agency \\nwill  be  paying  for  the  transportation,  and \\nthe  trips  are  reserved  to  the  agency,  for \\nwhichever  12  people  the  agency  designates, \\nthe provider may then negotiate any price it \\ncan with the agency for the trips. We distin-\\nguish  this  situation  from  one  in  which  an \\nagency  employee,  as  a  service,  calls  and \\nmakes an individual reservation in the name \\nof  a  client,  where  the  client  will  be  paying \\nfor the transportation. \\n\\nRESTRICTIONS AND PRIORITIES BASED ON TRIP \\nPURPOSE \\n\\nThis  is  a  simple  and  straightforward  re-\\nquirement.  There  can  be  no  restrictions  or \\npriorities  based  on  trip  purpose  in  a  com-\\nparable  complementary  paratransit  system. \\nWhen  a  user  reserves  a  trip,  the  entity  will \\nneed to know the origin, destination, time of \\ntravel,  and  how  many  people  are  traveling. \\nThe  entity  does  not  need  to  know  why  the \\nperson is traveling, and should not even ask. \\n\\nHOURS AND DAYS OF SERVICE \\n\\nThis criterion says simply that if a person \\ncan  travel  to  a  given  destination  using  a \\ngiven  fixed  route  at  a  given  time  of  day,  an \\nADA paratransit eligible person must be able \\nto  travel  to  that  same  destination  on  para-\\ntransit  at  that  time  of  day.  This  criterion \\nrecognizes that the shape of the service area \\ncan change. Late at night, for example, it is \\ncommon  for  certain  routes  not  to  be  run. \\nThose  routes,  and  their  paratransit  cor-\\nridors,  do  not  need  to  be  served  with  para-\\ntransit  when  the  fixed  route  system  is  not \\nrunning  on  them.  One  couldn’t  get  to  des-\\ntinations  in  that  corridor  by  fixed  route  at \\nthose  times,  so  paratransit  service  is  not \\nnecessary either. \\n\\nIt  should  be  pointed  out  that  service  dur-\\ning  low-demand  times  need  not  be  by  the \\nsame  paratransit  mode  as  during  higher \\nusage  periods.  For  example,  if  a  provider \\n\\n512 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00522 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cOffice of the Secretary of Transportation \\n\\nPt. 37, App. D \\n\\nuses its own paratransit vans during high de-\\nmand  periods,  it  could  use  a  private  con-\\ntractor  or  user-side  subsidy  provider  during \\nlow  demand  periods.  This  would  presumably \\nbe  a  more  efficient  way  of  providing  late \\nnight  service.  A  call-forwarding  device  for \\ncommunication  with  the  auxiliary  carrier \\nduring these low demand times would be per-\\nfectly  acceptable,  and could  reduce adminis-\\ntrative costs. \\n\\nCAPACITY CONSTRAINTS \\n\\nThis  provision  specifically  prohibits  two \\ncommon  mechanisms  that  limit  use  of  a \\nparatransit  system  so  as  to  constrain  de-\\nmand  on  its  capacity.  The  first  is  a  waiting \\nlist. Tyically, a waiting list involves a deter-\\nmination  by  a  provider  that  it  can  provide \\nservice  only  to  a  given  number  of  eligible \\npersons.  Other  eligible  persons  are  not  able \\nto  receive  service  until  one  of  the  people \\nbeing  served  moves  away  or  otherwise  no \\nlonger uses the service. Then the persons on \\nthe waiting list can move up. The process is \\nanalogous  to  the  wait  that  persons  in  some \\ncities  have  to  endure  to  be  able  to  buy  sea-\\nson tickets to a sold-out slate of professional \\nfootball games. \\n\\nThe  second  mechanism  specifically  men-\\ntioned  is  a  number  limit  on  the  trips  a  pas-\\nsenger can take in a given period of time. It \\nis a kind of rationing in which, for example, \\nif  one  has  taken  his  quota  of  30  trips  this \\nmonth,  he  cannot  take  further  trips  for  the \\nrest of the month. \\n\\nIn  addition,  this  paragraph  prohibits  any \\noperational  pattern  or  practice  that  signifi-\\ncantly  limits  the  availability  of  service  of \\nADA  paratransit  eligible  persons.  As  dis-\\ncussed under § 37.125 in the context of missed \\ntrips  by  passengers,  a  ‘‘pattern  or  practice’’ \\ninvolves,  regular,  or  repeated  actions,  not \\nisolated, accidental, or singular incidents. A \\nmissed  trip,  late  arrival,  or  trip  denial  now \\nand then does not trigger this provision. \\n\\nOperational  problems  outside  the  control \\nof  the  entity  do  not  count  as  part  of  a  pat-\\ntern or practice under this provision. For ex-\\nample,  if  the  vehicle  has  an  accident  on  the \\nway  to  pick  up  a  passenger,  the  late  arrival \\nwould not count as part of a pattern or prac-\\ntice.  If  something  that  could  not  have  been \\nanticipated  at  the  time  the  trip  was  sched-\\nuled  (e.g.,  a  snowstorm,  an  accident  or  haz-\\nardous  materials  incident  that  traps  the \\nparatransit  vehicle,  like  all  traffic  on  a  cer-\\ntain  highway,  for  hours),  the  resulting \\nmissed trip would not count as part of a pat-\\ntern or practice. On the other hand, if the en-\\ntity regularly does not maintain its vehicles \\nwell,  such  that  frequent  mechanical  break-\\ndowns result in missed trips or late arrivals, \\na pattern or practice may exist. This is also \\ntrue in a situation in which scheduling prac-\\ntices  fail  to  take  into  account  regularly  oc-\\ncurring  traffic  conditions  (e.g.,  rush  hour \\n\\ntraffic  jams),  resulting  in  frequent  late  ar-\\nrivals. \\n\\nThe  rule  mentions  three  specific  examples \\nof  operational  patterns  or  practices  that \\nwould  violate  this  provision.  The  first  is  a \\npattern or practice of substantial numbers of \\nsignificantly  untimely  pickups  (either  for \\ninitial or return trips). To violate this provi-\\nsion,  there  must  be  both  a  substantial  num-\\nber  of  late  arrivals  and  the  late  arrivals  in \\nquestion  must  be  significant  in  length.  For \\nexample,  a  DOT  Inspector  General’s  (IG)  re-\\nport  on  one  city’s  paratransit  system  dis-\\nclosed  that  around  30  percent  of  trips  were \\nbetween one and five hours late. Such a situ-\\nation  would  trigger  this  provision.  On  the \\nother hand, only a few instances of trips one \\nto five hours late, or many instances of trips \\na  few  minutes  late,  would  not  trigger  this \\nprovision. \\n\\nThe second example is substantial numbers \\nof  trip  denials  or  missed  trips.  For  example, \\nif  on  a  regular  basis  the  reservation  phone \\nlines  open  at  5  a.m.  and  callers  after  7  a.m. \\nare  all  told  that  they  cannot  travel,  or  the \\nphone  lines  shut  down  after  7  a.m.  and  a  re-\\ncorded  message  says  to  call  back  the  next \\nday,  or  the  phone  lines  are  always  so  busy \\nthat  no  one  can  get  through,  this  provision \\nwould  be  triggered.  (Practices  of  this  kind \\nwould  probably  violate  the  response  time \\ncriterion as well.) Also, if, on a regular basis, \\nthe  entity  misses  a  substantial  number  of \\ntrips  (e.g.,  a  trip  is  scheduled,  the  passenger \\nis waiting, but the vehicle never comes, goes \\nto the wrong address, is extremely late, etc.), \\nit would violate this provision. \\n\\nThe  third  example  is  substantial  numbers \\nof  trips  with  excessive  trip  lengths.  Since \\nparatransit  is  a  shared  ride  service,  para-\\ntransit  rides  between  Point  A  and  Point  B \\nwill  usually  take  longer,  and  involve  more \\nintermediate stops, than a taxi ride between \\nthe  same  two  points.  However,  when  the \\nnumber  of  intermediate  stops  and  the  total \\ntrip  time  for  a  given  passenger  grows  so \\nlarge  as  to  make  use  of  the  system  prohibi-\\ntively  inconvenient,  then  this  provision \\nwould  be  triggered.  For  example,  the  IG  re-\\nport referred to above mentioned a situation \\nin  which  9  percent  of  riders  had  one  way \\ntrips  averaging  between  two  and  four  hours, \\nwith  an  average  of  16  intermediate  stops. \\nSuch a situation would probably trigger this \\nprovision. \\n\\nThough  these  three  examples  probably \\ncover  the  most  frequently  cited  problems  in \\nparatransit  operations  that  directly  or  indi-\\nrectly  limit  the  provision  of  service  that  is \\ntheoretically  available  to  eligible  persons, \\nthe  list  is  not  exhaustive.  Other  patterns  or \\npractices  could  trigger  this  provision.  For \\nexample,  the  Department  has  heard  about  a \\nsituation  in  which  an  entity’s  paratransit \\ncontractor  was  paid  on  a  per-trip  basis,  re-\\ngardless  of  the  length  of  the  trip.  The  con-\\ntractor  therefore  had  an  economic  incentive \\n\\n513 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00523 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cPt. 37, App. D \\n\\n49 CFR Subtitle A (10–1–21 Edition) \\n\\nto provide as many trips as possible. As a re-\\nsult, the contractor accepted short trips and \\nroutinely  denied  longer  trips.  This  would  be \\na  pattern  or  practice  contrary  to  this  provi-\\nsion (and contrary to the service area provi-\\nsion as well). \\n\\nADDITIONAL SERVICE \\n\\nThis  provision  emphasizes  that  entities \\nmay go beyond the requirements of this sec-\\ntion in providing service to ADA paratransit \\nindividuals. For example, no one is precluded \\nfrom offering service in a larger service area, \\nduring  greater  hours  than  the  fixed  route \\nsystem, or without charge. However, costs of \\nsuch additional service do not count with re-\\nspect  to  undue  financial  burden  waiver  re-\\nquests. Where a service criterion itself incor-\\nporates  a  range  of  actions  the  entity  may \\ntake  (e.g.,  providing  wide  corridors  outside \\nthe  urban  core,  using  real  time  scheduling), \\nhowever,  costs  of  providing  that  optional \\nservice  may  be  counted  for  undue  financial \\nburden waiver request purposes. \\n\\nSection 37.133 Subscription Service \\n\\nAs part of its paratransit service, an entity \\nmay  include  a  subscription  service  compo-\\nnent. However, at any given time of day, this \\ncomponent may not absorb more than 50 per-\\ncent  of  available  capacity  on  the  total  sys-\\ntem.  For  example,  if,  at  8  a.m.,  the  system \\ncan  provide  400  trips,  no  more  than  200  of \\nthese can be subscription trips. \\n\\nThe one exception to this rule would occur \\nin  a  situation  in  which  there  is  excess  non- \\nsubscription  capacity  available.  For  exam-\\nple,  if  over  a  long  enough  period  of  time  to \\nestablish a pattern, there were only 150 non- \\nsubscription  trips  requested  at  8  a.m.,  the \\nprovider  could begin to  provide  250 subscrip-\\ntion trips at that time. Subsequently, if non- \\nsubscription  demand  increased  over  a  period \\nof time, such that the 50 trips were needed to \\nsatisfy a regular non-subscription demand at \\nthat  time,  and  overall  system  capacity  had \\nnot  increased,  the  50  trips  would  have  to  be \\nreturned  to  the  non-subscription  category. \\nDuring  times  of  high  subscription  demand, \\nentities  could  use  the  trip  time  negotiation \\ndiscretion  of  § 37.131(c)(2)  to  shift  some  trips \\nto other times. \\n\\nBecause  subscription  service  is  a  limited \\nsubcomponent  of  paratransit  service,  the \\nrule permits restrictions to be imposed on its \\nuse  that  could  not  be  imposed  elsewhere. \\nThere  may  be  a  waiting  list  for  provision  of \\nsubscription  service  or  the  use  of  other  ca-\\npacity  constraints.  Also,  there  may  be  re-\\nstrictions or priorities based on trip purpose. \\nFor  example,  subscription  service  under \\npeak  work  trip  times  could  be  limited  to \\nwork  trips.  We  emphasize  that  these  limita-\\ntions apply only to subscription service. It is \\nacceptable  for  a  provider  to  put  a  person  on \\na waiting list for access to subscription serv-\\n\\nice at 8 a.m. for work trips; the same person \\ncould  not  be  wait-listed  for  access  to  para-\\ntransit service in general. \\n\\nSection 37.135 Submission of Paratransit Plans \\n\\nThis  section  contains  the  general  require-\\nments  concerning  the  submission  of  para-\\ntransit  plans.  Each  public  entity  operating \\nfixed route service is required to develop and \\nsubmit a plan for paratransit service. Where \\nyou  send  your  plans  depends  on  the  type  of \\nentity  you  are.  There  are  two  categories  of \\nentities  which  should  submit  their  plans  to \\nstates—(1)  FTA  recipients  and  (2)  entities \\nwho  are  administered  by  the  state  on  behalf \\nof FTA. \\n\\nThese  FTA  grantees  submit  their  plans  to \\nthe states because the agency would like the \\nbenefit  of  the  states’  expertise  before  final \\nreview.  The  states’  role  is  as  a  commenter, \\nnot as a reviewer. \\n\\nThis  section  also  specifies  annual  progress \\nreports concerning the meeting of previously \\napproved  milestones,  any  slippage  (with  the \\nreasons for it and plans to catch up), and any \\nsignificant  changes  in  the  operator’s  envi-\\nronment,  such  as  the  withdrawal  from  the \\nmarketplace  of  a  private  paratransit  pro-\\nvider  or  whose  service  the  entity  has  relied \\nupon  to  provide  part  of  its  paratransit  serv-\\nice. \\n\\nParagraph  (d)  of  this  section  specifies  a \\nmaximum time period for the phase-in of the \\nimplementation  of  paratransit  plans.  The \\nDepartment recognizes that it is not reason-\\nable  to  expect  paratransit  systems  to  spring \\ninto  existence  fully  formed,  like  Athena \\nfrom the head of Zeus. Under this paragraph, \\nall  entities  must  be  in  full  compliance  with \\nall  paratransit  provisions  by  January  26, \\n1997,  unless  the  entity  has  received  a  waiver \\nfrom  FTA  based  on  undue  financial  burden \\n(which applies only to the service criteria of \\n§ 37.131,  not  to  eligibility  requirements  or \\nother paratransit provisions). \\n\\nWhile  the  rule  assumes  that  most  entities \\nwill  take  a  year  to  fully  implement  these \\nprovisions,  longer  than  a  year  requires  the \\nparatransit  plans  to  submit  milestones  that \\nare susceptible to objective verification. Not \\nall  plans  will  be  approved  with  a  five-year \\nlead-in  period.  Consistent  with  the  proposed \\nrule, the Department intends to look at each \\nplan  individually  to  see  what  is  required  for \\nimplementation  in  each  case.  DOT  may  ap-\\nprove  only  a  shorter  phase-in  period  in  a \\ngiven case. \\n\\nSection 37.137 Paratransit Plan Development \\n\\nSection  35.137  establishes  three  principal \\nrequirements  in  the  development  of  para-\\ntransit plans. \\n\\nFirst is the requirement to survey existing \\nparatransit  services  within  the  service  area. \\nThis  is  required  by  section  223(c)(8)  of  the \\nADA. While the ADA falls short of explicitly \\n\\n514 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00524 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cOffice of the Secretary of Transportation \\n\\nPt. 37, App. D \\n\\nrequiring coordination, clearly this is one of \\nthe goals. The purpose of the survey is to de-\\ntermine  what  is  being  provided  already,  so \\nthat a transit provider can accurately assess \\nwhat additional service is needed to meet the \\nservice  criteria  for  comparable  paratransit \\nservice.  The  plan  does  not  have  to  discuss \\nprivate  paratransit  providers  whose  services \\nwill not be used to help meet paratransit re-\\nquirements  under  this  rule.  However,  the \\npublic  entity  will  need  to  know  specifically \\nwhat services are being provided by whom if \\nthe entity is to count the transportation to-\\nward the overall need. \\n\\nSince  the  public  entity  is  required  to  pro-\\nvide paratransit to all ADA paratransit eligi-\\nble  individuals,  there  is  some  concern  that \\ncurrently  provided  service  may  be  cut  back \\nor  eliminated.  It  is  possible  that  this  may \\nhappen  and  such  action  would  have  a  nega-\\ntive effect on transportation provided to per-\\nsons with disabilities in general. The Depart-\\nment urges each entity required to submit a \\nplan to work with current providers of trans-\\nportation, not only to determine what trans-\\nportation  services  they  provide,  but  also  to \\ncontinue  to  provide  service  into  the  foresee-\\nable future. \\n\\nSecond,  § 37.137  specifies  requirements  for \\npublic  participation.  First,  the  entity  must \\nperform  outreach,  to  ensure  that  a  wide \\nrange of persons anticipated to use the para-\\ntransit  service  know  about  and  have  the  op-\\nportunity  to  participate  in  the  development \\nof  the  plan.  Not  only  must  the  entity  iden-\\ntify who these individuals or groups are, the \\nentity  also  must  contact  the  people  at  an \\nearly stage in the development process. \\n\\nThe  other  public  participation  require-\\nments  are  straightforward.  There  must  be  a \\npublic  hearing  and  an  opportunity  to  com-\\nment.  The  hearing  must  be  accessible  to \\nthose  with  disabilities,  and  notice  of  the \\nhearing  must  be  accessible  as  well.  There  is \\na  special  efforts  test  identified  in  this  para-\\ngraph for comments concerning a multi-year \\nphase-in of a paratransit plan. \\n\\nThe  final  general  requirement  of  the  sec-\\ntion specifies that efforts at public participa-\\ntion must be made permanent through some \\nmechanism that provides for participation in \\nall  phases  of  paratransit  plan  development \\nand  submission.  The  Department  is  not  re-\\nquiring that there be an advisory committee \\nestablished,  although  this  is  one  method  of \\ninstitutionalizing participation. The Depart-\\nment  is  not  as  interested  in  the  specific \\nstructure used to ensure public participation \\nas  we  are  interested  in  the  effectiveness  of \\nthe effort. \\n\\nThe  Department  believes  that  public  par-\\nticipation  is  a  key  element  in  the  effective \\nimplementation  of  the  ADA.  The  ADA  is  an \\nopportunity  to  develop  programs  that  will \\nensure the integration of all persons into not \\njust  the  transportation  system  of  America, \\nbut  all  of  the  opportunities  transportation \\n\\nmakes  possible.  This  opportunity  is  not \\nwithout  tremendous  challenges  to  the  tran-\\nsit  providers.  It  is  only  through  dialogue, \\nover  the  long  term,  that  usable,  possible \\nplans can be developed and implemented. \\n\\nSection 37.139 Plan Contents \\n\\nThis  section  contains  substantive  cat-\\negories of information to be contained in the \\nparatransit plan: Information on current and \\nchanging  fixed  route  service;  inventory  of \\nexisting  paratransit  service;  discussion  of \\nthe  discrepancies  between  existing  para-\\ntransit and what is required under this regu-\\nlation;  a  discussion  of  the  public  participa-\\ntion  requirements  and  how  they  have  been \\nmet;  the  plan  for  paratransit  service;  the \\nbudget for paratransit services; efforts to co-\\nordinate  with  other  transportation  pro-\\nviders;  a  description  of  the  process  in  place \\nor to be used to register ADA paratransit eli-\\ngible  individuals;  a  description  of  the  docu-\\nmentation  provided  to  each \\nindividual \\nverifying  eligibility;  and  a  request  for  a \\nwaiver  based  on  undue  financial  burden,  if \\napplicable.  The  final  rule  contains  a  reorga-\\nnized  and  slightly  expanded  section  on  plan \\ncontents,  reflecting  requests  to  be  more  ex-\\nplicit, rather than less explicit. \\n\\nThe  list  of  required  elements  is  the  same \\nfor  all  entities  required  to  submit  para-\\ntransit  plans.  There  is  no  document  length \\nrequirement, however. Each entity (or group \\nplan) is unique and we expect the plans to re-\\nflect  this.  While  we  would  like  the  plan  ele-\\nments  presented  in  the  order  listed  in  this \\nsection,  the  contents  most  likely  will  vary \\ngreatly,  depending  on  the  size,  geographic \\narea, budget, complexity of issues, etc. of the \\nparticular submitting agency. \\n\\nThis section and § 37.139 provide for a max-\\nimum  phase-in  period  of  five  years,  with  an \\nassumed  one-year  phase-in  for  all  para-\\ntransit  programs.  (The  required  budget  has \\nbeen  changed  to  five  years  as  well.)  The  De-\\npartment  has  established  a  maximum  five- \\nyear  phase-in  in  the  belief  that  not  all  sys-\\ntems  will  require  that  long,  but  that  some, \\nparticularly those which had chosen to meet \\ncompliance  with  section  504  requirements \\nwith  accessible  fixed  route  service,  may  in-\\ndeed need five years. \\n\\nWe  are  confident  that,  through  the  public \\nparticipation  process,  entities  can  develop  a \\nrealistic  plan  for  full  compliance  with  the \\nADA.  To  help  ensure  this,  the  paratransit \\nplan  contents  section  now  requires  that  any \\nplan  which  projects  full  compliance  after \\nJanuary  26,  1993  must  include  milestones \\nwhich  can  be  measured  and  which  result  in \\nsteady  progress  toward  full  compliance.  For \\nexample,  it  is  possible  that  the  first  part  of \\nyear  one  is  used  to  ensure  comprehensive \\nregistration  of  all  eligible  persons  with  dis-\\nabilities,  training  of  transit  provider  staffs \\nand  the  development  and  dissemination  of \\ninformation  to  users  and  potential  users  in \\n\\n515 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00525 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cPt. 37, App. D \\n\\n49 CFR Subtitle A (10–1–21 Edition) \\n\\naccessible formats and some modest increase \\nin  paratransit  service  is  provided.  A  plan \\nwould  not  be  permitted  to  indicate  that  no \\nactivity  was  possible  in  the  first  year,  but \\nproportionately  more  progress  could  be \\nplanned  for  later  years  than  for  the  first \\nyear. Implementation must begin in January \\n1992. \\n\\nEach  plan,  including  its  proposed  phase-in \\nperiod, will be the subject of examination by \\nFTA.  Not  all  providers  who  request  a  five- \\nyear phase-in will receive approval for a five- \\nyear  phase-in.  The  plan  must  be  careful, \\ntherefore,  to  explain  what  current  services \\nare,  what  the  projections  are,  and  what \\nmethods  are  in  place  to  determine  and  pro-\\nvide  accountability  for  progress  toward  full \\ncompliance. \\n\\nWe  have  been  asked  for  assistance  in  as-\\nsessing  what  the  demand  for  paratransit \\nservice will be. FTA’s ADA Paratransit Man-\\nual  provides  detailed  assistance  in  this  and \\nmany  other  areas  of  the  plan  development \\nprocess. \\n\\nThe  ADA  itself  contained  a  figure  of  43 \\nmillion  persons  with  disabilities.  It  should \\nbe  pointed  out  that  many  of  these  may  not \\nnecessarily  be  eligible  for  ADA  paratransit \\nservice. The Department’s regulatory impact \\nanalysis  discussing  the  probable  costs  in-\\nvolved  in  implementing  this  rule  places  the \\npossible percentage of population who would \\nbe eligible for paratransit service at between \\n1.4  and  1.9  percent.  This  figure  can  vary  de-\\npending  on  the  type  and  variety  of  services \\nyou have available, or on such things as cli-\\nmate, proximity to medical care, family, etc. \\nthat  a  person  with  a  disability  may  need. \\nClearly  estimating  demand  is  one  of  the \\nmost  critical  elements  in  the  plan,  since  it \\nwill  be  used  to  make  decisions  about  all  of \\nthe various service criteria. \\n\\nSection 37.139 contains a new paragraph (j), \\nspelling  out  in  more  detail  requirements  re-\\nlated  to  the  annual  submission  of  plans. \\nSince  there  is  now  the  possibility  for  five- \\nyear  phase-ins,  the  annual  plan  dem-\\nonstrates the progress made to date, and ex-\\nplains any delays. \\n\\nSection 37.141 Requirements If a Joint Plan is \\nSubmitted \\n\\nThe Department believes that, particularly \\nin  large,  multi-provider  regions,  a  coordi-\\nnated  regional  paratransit  plan  and  system \\nare  extremely  important.  Such  coordination \\ncan  do  much  to  ensure  that  the  most  com-\\nprehensive  transportation  can  be  provided \\nwith  the  most  efficient  use  of  available  re-\\nsources.  We  recognize  that  the  effort  of  put-\\nting together such a coordinated system can \\nbe a lengthy one. This section is intended to \\nfacilitate  the  process  of  forming  such  a  co-\\nordinated system. \\n\\nIf  a  number  of  entities  wish  to  submit  a \\njoint  plan  for  a  coordinated  system,  they \\nmust, like other entities, submit a document \\n\\nby January 26, 1992. At a minimum, this doc-\\nument must include the following: \\n\\n(1)  A  general  statement  that  the  partici-\\npating  entities  intend  to  file  a  joint  coordi-\\nnated plan; \\n\\n(2)  A  certification  from  each  participating \\nentity  that  it  is  committed  to  providing \\nparatransit as a part of a coordinated plan; \\n\\n(3)  A  certification  from  each  participating \\nentity that it will maintain at least current \\nlevels of paratransit service until the coordi-\\nnated  paratransit  service  called  for  by  the \\njoint plan is implemented; \\n\\n(4)  As  many  elements  of  the  plan  as  pos-\\n\\nsible. \\n\\nThese  provisions  ensure  that  significant \\nplanning will precede, and plan implementa-\\ntion  will  begin  by,  January  26,  1992,  without \\nprecluding entities from cooperating because \\nit was not possible to complete coordinating \\ndifferent  public  entities  by  that  date.  The \\nentities involved in a joint plan are required \\nto submit all elements of their plan by July \\n26, 1992. \\n\\nThe  final  provision  in  the  section  notes \\nthat  an  entity  may  later  join  a  coordinated \\nplan, even if it has filed its own plan on Jan-\\nuary 26, 1992. An entity must submit its own \\nplan  by  January  26,  1992,  if  it  has  not  pro-\\nvided  a  certification  of  participation  in  a \\njoint  plan.).  In  this  case,  the  entity  must \\nprovide the assurances and certifications re-\\nquired  of  all  of  the  other  participating  enti-\\nties. \\n\\nThe  Department  fully  expects  that  many \\njurisdictions filing joint plans will be able to \\ndo so by January 26, 1992. For those who can-\\nnot,  the  regulatory  provision  ensures  that \\nthere will be no decrease in paratransit serv-\\nice. Further, since we anticipate coordinated \\nservice  areas  to  provide  more  effective  serv-\\nice, complete implementation of a joint plan \\ncould  be  more  rapid  than  if  each  entity  was \\nproviding service on its own. \\n\\nEntities  submitting  a  joint  plan  do  not \\nhave  any  longer  than  any  other  entities  to \\nfully  implement  complementary  paratransit \\nservice.  In  any  case,  all  plans  (joint  or  sin-\\ngle)  must  be  fully  implemented  by  January \\n26,  1997,  absent  a  waiver  for  undue  financial \\nburden  (which  would,  in  the  case  of  a  joint \\nplan, be considered on a joint basis). \\n\\nSection 37.143 Paratransit Plan \\nImplementation \\n\\nAs  already  discussed  under  § 37.135,  the \\nstates  will  receive  FTA  recipient  plans  for \\nrecipients of funding under 49 U.S.C. 5311 ad-\\nministered by the State or any small urban-\\nized  area  recipient  of  funds  under  49  U.S.C. \\n5307  administered  by  a  state.

This \\ncomment  is  very  important  for  FTA  to  re-\\nceive,  since  states  administer  these  pro-\\ngrams on behalf of FTA. Each state’s specific \\nknowledge  of  FTA  grantees  it  administers \\nwill  provide  helpful  information  to  FTA  in \\nmaking its decisions. \\n\\nThe  rule  lists  five  questions  the  states \\nmust  answer  when  they  forward  the  plans. \\nThese  questions  are  gauged  to  capitalize  on \\nthe working knowledge the states possess on \\nthe  grantees.  FTA  will  send  a  more  specific \\nletter of instruction to each state explaining \\nits role. \\n\\nSection 37.147 FTA Review of Plans \\n\\nThis  provision  spells  out  factors  FTA  will \\nconsider  in  reviewing  each  plan,  including \\nwhether the submission is complete, whether \\nthe  plan  complies  with  the  substance  of  the \\nADA  regulation,  whether  the  entity  com-\\nplied  with  the  public  participation  require-\\nments  in  developing  the  plan,  efforts  by  the \\nentity to coordinate with other entities in a \\nplan  submission,  and  any  comments  sub-\\nmitted by the states. \\n\\nThese elements are not the only items that \\nwill  be  reviewed  by  FTA.  Every  portion  of \\nthe  plan  will  be  reviewed  and  assessed  for \\ncompliance with the regulation. This section \\nmerely  highlights  those  provisions  thought \\nmost important by the Department. \\n\\nSection 37.151 Waiver for Undue Financial \\nBurden \\n\\nThe  Department  has  adopted  a  five-year \\nphase-in  for  paratransit  service.  Under  this \\nscheme,  each  entity  required  to  provide \\nparatransit  service  will  be  able  to  design  a \\nphase-in  of  its  service  specifically  geared  to \\nlocal  circumstances.  While  all  jurisdictions \\nwill  not  receive  approval  for  plans  with  a \\nfive year phase-in, each entity will be able to \\nrequest  what  it  needs  based  on  local  cir-\\ncumstances. Generally, the section allows an \\nentity to request a wavier at any time it de-\\ntermines  that  it  will  not  be  able  to  meet  a \\nfive-year  phase-in  or  make  measured \\nprogress  toward  its  full  compliance  date \\nspecified in its original plan. \\n\\nA waiver for undue financial burden should \\nbe  requested  if  one  of  the  following  cir-\\ncumstances  applies.  First,  when  the  entity \\nsubmits  its  first  plan  on  January  26,  1992,  if \\nthe entity knows it will not be able to reach \\nfull  compliance  within  five  years,  or  if  the \\nentity  cannot  make  measured  progress  the \\nfirst  year  it  may  submit  a  waiver  request. \\nThe entity also should apply for a waiver, if, \\nduring  plan \\nimplementation,  there  are \\nchanged  circumstances  which  make  it  un-\\nlikely that compliance will be possible. \\n\\nThe  concept  of  measured  progress  should \\nbe  given  its  plain  meaning.  It  is  not  accept-\\nable  to  submit  a  plan  which  shows  signifi-\\n\\ncant  progress  in  implementing  a  plan  in \\nyears four and five, but no progress in years \\none and two. Similarly, the progress must be \\nsusceptible  to  objective  verification.  An  en-\\ntity  cannot  merely  ‘‘work  toward’’  devel-\\noping a particular aspect of a plan. \\n\\nfinancial \\n\\nThe  Department  intends  that  undue  bur-\\nden waiver requests will be given close scru-\\ntiny,  and  waiver  will  not  be  granted  highly. \\nIn reviewing requests, however, as the legis-\\nlative history indicates, FTA will look at the \\nindividual \\nconstraints  within \\nwhich  each  public  entity  operates  its  fixed \\nroute  system.  ‘‘Any  determination  of  undue \\nfinancial  burden  cannot  have  assumed  the \\ncollection  of  additional  revenues,  such  as \\nthose  received  through  increases  in  local \\ntaxes  or  legislative  appropriations,  which \\nwould  not  have  otherwise  been  made  avail-\\nable  to  the  fixed  route  operator.’’  (H.  Rept. \\n101–485, Pt. 1, at 31) \\n\\nSection 37.153 FTA Waiver Determination \\n\\nIf  the  FTA  Administrator  grants  a  waiver \\nfor  undue  financial  burden,  the  waiver  will \\nbe for a specified period of time and the Ad-\\nministrator  will  determine  what  the  entity \\nmust  do  to  meet  its  responsibilities  under \\nthe  ADA.  Each  determination  will  involve  a \\njudgment  of  what  is  appropriate  on  a  case- \\nby-case  basis.  Since  each  waiver  will  be \\ngranted  based  on  individual  circumstances, \\nthe Department does not deem it appropriate \\nto specify a generally applicable duration for \\na waiver. \\n\\nWhen a waiver is granted, the rule calls for \\nentities to look first at limiting the number \\nof  trips  provided  to  each  individual  as  a \\nmeans of providing service that does not cre-\\nate  an  undue  burden.  This  capacity  con-\\nstraint,  unlike  manipulations  of  other  serv-\\nice  criteria,  will  not  result  in  a  degradation \\nof the quality of service. An entity intending \\nto  submit  an  undue  burden  waiver  request \\nshould take this approach into account in its \\nplanning process. \\n\\nIt should be noted that requiring an entity \\nto provide paratransit service at least during \\ncore  hours  along  key  routes  is  one  option \\nthat  the  Administrator  has  available  in \\nmaking  a  decision  about  the  service  to  be \\nprovided.  This  requirement  stems  from  the \\nstatutory  provision  that  the  Administrator \\ncan require the entity to provide a minimum \\nlevel of service, even if to do so would be an \\nundue  financial  burden.  Certainly  part  of  a \\nrequest  for  a  waiver  could  be  a  locally  en-\\ndorsed  alternative  to  this  description  of \\nbasic  service.  The  rule  states  explicitly  the \\nAdministrator’s  discretion  to  return  the  ap-\\nplication  for  more  information  if  necessary. \\n\\nSection 37.155 Factors in Decision To Grant an \\nUndue Financial Burden Waiver \\n\\nFactors the Administrator will consider in \\nmaking  a  decision  whether  to  grant  an \\n\\n517 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00527 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cPt. 37, App. D \\n\\n49 CFR Subtitle A (10–1–21 Edition) \\n\\nundue  financial  burden  waiver  request  in-\\nclude  effects  on  current  fixed  route  service, \\nreductions  in  other  services,  increases  in \\nfares, resources available to implement com-\\nplementary  paratransit  over  the  period  of \\nthe  plan,  current  level  of  accessible  service \\n(fixed  route  and  paratransit),  cooperation \\namong  transit  providers,  evidence  of  in-\\ncreased  efficiencies  that  have  been  or  could \\nbe used, any unique circumstances that may \\naffect  the  entity’s  ability  to  provide  para-\\ntransit service, the level of per capita service \\nbeing  provided,  both  to  the  population  as  a \\nwhole and what is being or anticipated to be \\nprovided to persons who are eligible and reg-\\nistered to receive ADA paratransit service. \\n\\nThis final element allows some measure of \\ncomparability,  regardless  of  the  specific \\nservice criteria and should assist in a general \\nassessment of level of effort. \\n\\nIt  is  only  the  costs  associated  with  pro-\\nviding  paratransit  service  to  ADA-para-\\ntransit  eligible  persons  that  can  be  counted \\nin assessing whether or not there is an undue \\nfinancial  burden.  Two  cost  factors  are  in-\\ncluded  in  the  considerations  which  enhance \\nthe  Administrator’s  ability  to  assess  real \\ncommitment to these paratransit provisions. \\nFirst,  the  Department  will  allow  a  statis-\\ntically  valid  methodology  for  estimating \\nnumber of trips mandated by the ADA. While \\nthe  regulation  calls  for  a  trip-by-trip  deter-\\nmination  of  eligibility,  this  provision  recog-\\nnizes  that  this  is  not  possible  for  some  sys-\\ntems,  particularly  the  large  systems.  Since \\nonly those trips provided to a person when he \\nor she is ADA eligible may be counted in de-\\ntermining  an  undue  financial  burden,  this \\nprovision is necessary. \\n\\nSecond, in determining costs to be counted \\ntoward  providing  paratransit  service,  para-\\ngraph (b)(3) allows an entity to include in its \\nparatransit  budget  dollars  to  which  it  is  le-\\ngally  entitled,  but  which,  as  a  matter  of \\nstate or local funding arrangements, are pro-\\nvided to another entity that is actually pro-\\nviding the paratransit service. \\n\\nFor example, a state government may pro-\\nvide a certain formula allocation of the rev-\\nenue  from  a  certain  tax  to  each  jurisdiction \\nfor use in providing transportation service at \\nthe local level. The funds, depending on local \\narrangements,  may  flow  either  to  a  transit \\nauthority—a  regulated  entity  under  this \\nrule—or  to  a  city  or  county  government.  If \\nthe  funds  go  to  the  transit  authority,  they \\nclearly  may  be  counted  in  an  undue  burden \\ncalculation. In addition, however, this provi-\\nsion also  allows  funds that  flow  through the \\ncity  or  county  government  to  be  counted  in \\nthe undue burden calculation, since they are \\nbasically  the  same  funds  and  should  not  be \\ntreated  differently  based  on  the  accident  of \\npreviously-determined  local  arrangements. \\nOn  the  other  hand,  this  provision  does  not \\nallow  funds  of  a  private  non-profit  or  other \\norganization who uses Department of Health \\n\\nand  Human  Services  grant  or  private  con-\\ntributions  to  be  counted  toward  the  entity’s \\nfinancial commitment to paratransit. \\n\\nSUBPART G—PROVISION OF SERVICE \\n\\nSection 37.161 Maintenance of Accessible \\nFeatures—General \\n\\nThis  section  applies  to  all  entities  pro-\\nviding  transportation  services,  public  and \\nprivate.  It  requires  those  entities  to  main-\\ntain in operative condition those features or \\nfacilities and equipment that make facilities \\nand vehicles accessible to and usable by indi-\\nviduals with disabilities. \\n\\nThe  ADA  requires  that,  to  the  maximum \\nextent feasible, facilities be accessible to and \\nusable  by  individuals  with  disabilities.  This \\nsection recognizes that it is not sufficient to \\nprovide  features  such  as  lift-equipped  vehi-\\ncles,  elevators,  communications  systems  to \\nprovide information to people with vision or \\nhearing  impairments,  etc.  if  these  features \\nare not maintained in a manner that enables \\nindividuals with disabilities to use them. In-\\noperative lifts or elevators, locked accessible \\ndoors,  accessible  paths  of  travel  that  are \\nblocked  by  equipment  or  boxes  of  materials \\nare not accessible to or usable by individuals \\nwith disabilities. \\n\\nThe  rule  points  out  that  temporary  ob-\\nstructions  or  isolated  instances  of  mechan-\\nical  failure  would  not  be  considered  viola-\\ntions  of  the  ADA  or  this  rule.  Repairs  must \\nbe made ‘‘promptly.’’ The rule does not, and \\nprobably  could  not,  state  a  time  limit  for \\nmaking particular repairs, given the variety \\nof  circumstances  involved.  However,  repair-\\ning  accessible  features  must  be  made  a  high \\npriority.  Allowing  obstructions  or  out  of \\norder  accessibility  equipment  to  persist  be-\\nyond  a  reasonable  period  of  time  would  vio-\\nlate  this  Part,  as  would  mechanical  failures \\ndue to improper or inadequate maintenance. \\nFailure  of  the  entity  to  ensure  that  acces-\\nsible routes are free of obstruction and prop-\\nerly  maintained,  or \\nfailure  to  arrange \\nprompt  repair  of  inoperative  elevators,  lifts, \\nor  other  accessibility-related  equipment, \\nwould also violate this part. \\n\\nThe  rule  also  requires  that  accommoda-\\ntions be made to individuals with disabilities \\nwho  would  otherwise  use  an  inoperative  ac-\\ncessibility feature. For example, when a rail \\nsystem  discovers  that  an  elevator  is  out  of \\norder, blocking access to one of its stations, \\nit could accommodate users of the station by \\nannouncing the problem at other stations to \\nalert  passengers  and  offer  accessible  shuttle \\nbus  service  around  the  temporarily  inacces-\\nsible station. If a public address system were \\nout  of  order,  the  entity  could  designate  per-\\nsonnel  to  provide  information  to  customers \\nwith visual impairments. \\n\\n518 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00528 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cOffice of the Secretary of Transportation \\n\\nPt. 37, App. D \\n\\nSection 37.163 Keeping Vehicle Lifts in \\nOperative Condition—Public Entities \\n\\nThis section applies only to public entities. \\nOf  course,  like  vehicle  acquisition  require-\\nments  and  other  provisions  applying  to  pub-\\nlic  entities,  these  requirements  also  apply \\nwhen private entities ‘‘stand in the shoes’’ of \\npublic  entities  in  contracting  situations,  as \\nprovided in § 37.23. \\n\\nThis section’s first requirement is that the \\nentity establish a system of regular and fre-\\nquent  maintenance  checks  of  lifts  sufficient \\nto determine if they are operative. \\n\\nVehicle  and  equipment  maintenance  is  an \\nimportant  component  of  successful  acces-\\nsible  service.  In  particular,  an  aggressive \\npreventive  maintenance  program  for  lifts  is \\nessential. Lifts remain rather delicate pieces \\nof  machinery,  with  many  moving  parts, \\nwhich often must operate in a harsh environ-\\nment of potholes, dust and gravel, variations \\nin  temperature,  snow,  slush,  and  deicing \\ncompounds.  It  is  not  surprising  that  they \\nsometimes break down. \\n\\nThe point of a preventive maintenance pro-\\ngram  is  to  prevent  breakdowns,  of  course. \\nBut it is also important to catch broken lifts \\nas  soon  as  possible,  so  that  they  can  be  re-\\npaired  promptly.  Especially  in  a  bus  system \\nwith  relatively  low  lift  usage,  it  is  possible \\nthat a vehicle could go for a number of days \\nwithout  carrying  a  passenger  who  uses  the \\nlift. It is highly undesirable for the next pas-\\nsenger who needs a lift to be the person who \\ndiscovers  that  the  lift  is  broken,  when  a \\nmaintenance  check  by  the  operator  could \\nhave discovered the problem days earlier, re-\\nsulting in its repair. \\n\\nTherefore,  the  entity  must  have  a  system \\nfor regular and frequent checks, sufficient to \\ndetermine  if  lifts  are  actually  operative. \\nThis  is  not  a  requirement  for  the  lift  daily. \\n(Indeed, it is not, as such, a requirement for \\nlift  cycling  at  all.  If  there  is  another  means \\navailable  of  checking  the  lift,  it  may  be \\nused.)  If  alternate  day  checks,  for  example, \\nare  sufficient  to  determine  that  lifts  are  ac-\\ntually working, then they are permitted. If a \\nlift  is  used  in  service  on  a  given  day,  that \\nmay  be  sufficient  to  determine  that  the  lift \\nis  operative  with  respect  to  the  next  day.  It \\nwould  be  a  violation  of  this  part,  however, \\nfor the entity to neglect to check lifts regu-\\nlarly  and  frequently,  or  to  exhibit  a  pattern \\nof  lift  breakdowns  in  service  resulting  in \\nstranded  passengers  when  the  lifts  had  not \\nbeen checked before the vehicle failed to pro-\\nvide required accessibility to passengers that \\nday. \\n\\nWhen  a  lift  breaks  down  in  service,  the \\ndriver  must  let  the  entity  know  about  the \\nproblem by the most immediate means avail-\\nable.  If  the  vehicle  is  equipped  with  a  radio \\nor  telephone,  the  driver  must  call  in  the \\nproblem  on  the  spot.  If  not,  then  the  driver \\nwould have to make a phone call at the first \\n\\nopportunity (e.g., from a phone booth during \\nthe  turnaround  time  at  the  end  of  the  run). \\nIt  is  not  sufficient  to  wait  until  the  end  of \\nthe day and report the problem when the ve-\\nhicle returns to the barn. \\n\\nWhen a lift is discovered to be inoperative, \\neither  because  of  an  in-service  failure  or  as \\nthe result of  a maintenance check, the enti-\\nty  must  take  the  vehicle  out  of  service  be-\\nfore  the  beginning  of  its  next  service  day \\n(with  the  exception  discussed  below)  and  re-\\npair  the  lift  before  the  vehicle  is  put  back \\ninto service. In the case of an in-service fail-\\nure,  this  means  that  the  vehicle  can  con-\\ntinue  its  runs  on  that  day,  but  cannot  start \\na new service day before the lift is repaired. \\nIf  a  maintenance  check  in  the  evening  after \\ncompletion  of  a  day’s  run  or  in  the  morning \\nbefore  a  day’s  runs  discloses  the  problem, \\nthen the bus would not go into  service until \\nthe repair had taken place. \\n\\nThe Department realizes that, in the years \\nbefore  bus  fleets  are  completely  accessible, \\ntaking  buses  with  lifts  out  of  service  for  re-\\npairs in this way would probably result in an \\ninaccessible  spare  bus  being  used  on  the \\nroute,  but  at  least  attention  would  have  to \\nbe paid quickly to the lift repair, resulting in \\na  quicker  return  to  service  of  a  working  ac-\\ncessible bus. \\n\\nThe  rule  provides  an  exception  for  those \\nsituations in which there is no spare vehicle \\n(either  accessible  or  inaccessible)  available \\nto take the place of the vehicle with an oper-\\native  lift,  such  that  putting  the  latter  vehi-\\ncle into the shop would result in a reduction \\nof service to the public (e.g., a scheduled run \\non  a  route  could  not  be  made).  The  Depart-\\nment  would  emphasize  that  the  exception \\ndoes not apply when there is any spare vehi-\\ncle available. \\n\\nWhere  the  exception  does  apply,  the  pro-\\nvider  may  keep  the  vehicle  with  the  inoper-\\native  lift  in  service  for  a  maximum  of  three \\ndays  (for  providers  operating  in  an  area  of \\nover  50,000  population)  or  five  days  (for  pro-\\nviders  operating  in  an  area  of  50,000  popu-\\nlation  or  less).  After  these  times  have \\nelapsed,  the  vehicle  must  go  into  the  shop, \\nnot to return until the  lift is repaired. Even \\nduring the three- or five-day period, if an ac-\\ncessible  spare  bus  becomes  available  at  any \\ntime, it must be used in place of the bus with \\nthe  inoperative  lift  or  an  inaccessible  spare \\nthat is being used in its place. \\n\\nIn  a  fixed  route  system,  if  a  bus  is  oper-\\nating  without  a  working  lift  (either  on  the \\nday when the lift fails in service or as the re-\\nsult  of  the  exception  discussed  above)  and \\nheadways  between  accessible  buses  on  the \\nroute  on  which  the  vehicle  is  operating  ex-\\nceed  30  minutes,  the  entity  must  accommo-\\ndate  passengers  who  would  otherwise  be  in-\\nconvenienced  by  the  lack  of  an  accessible \\nbus.  This  accommodation  would  be  by  a \\nparatransit  or  other  special  vehicle  that \\nwould  pick  up  passengers  with  disabilities \\n\\n519 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00529 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cPt. 37, App. D \\n\\n49 CFR Subtitle A (10–1–21 Edition) \\n\\nwho  cannot  use  the  regular  bus  because  its \\nlift is inoperative. Passengers who need lifts \\nin  this  situation  would,  in  effect,  be  ADA \\nparatransit  eligible  under  the  second  eligi-\\nbility  category.  However,  since  they  would \\nhave  no  way  of  knowing  that  the  bus  they \\nsought to catch would not be accessible that \\nday, the transit authority must actively pro-\\nvide  alternative  service  to  them.  This  could \\nbe  done,  for  example,  by  having  a  ‘‘shadow’’ \\naccessible  service  available  along  the  route \\nor  having  the  bus  driver  call  in  the  minute \\nhe  saw  an  accessible  passenger  he  could  not \\npick  up  (including  the  original  passenger \\nstranded by an in-service lift failure), with a \\nshort  (i.e.,  less  than  30-minute)  response \\nfrom an accessible vehicle dispatched to pick \\nup  the  stranded  passenger.  To  minimize \\nproblems  in  providing  such  service,  when  a \\ntransit authority is using the ‘‘no spare vehi-\\ncles’’  exception,  the  entity  could  place  the \\nvehicle  with  the  inoperative  lift  on  a  route \\nwith  headways  between  accessible  buses \\nshorter than 30 minutes. \\n\\nSection 37.165 Lift and Securement Use \\n\\nThis  provision  applies  to  both  public  and \\n\\nprivate entities. \\n\\nAll people using wheelchairs, as defined in \\nthe rule, and other powered mobility devices, \\nunder  the  circumstances  provided  in  the \\nrule,  are  to  be  allowed  to  ride  the  entity’s \\nvehicles. \\n\\nEntities  may  require  wheelchair  users  to \\nride  in  designated  securement  locations. \\nThat  is,  the  entity  is  not  required  to  carry \\nwheelchair  users  whose  wheelchairs  would \\nhave  to  park  in  an  aisle  or  other  location \\nwhere  they  could  obstruct  other  persons’ \\npassage  or  where  they  could  not  be  secured \\nor  restrained.  An  entity’s  vehicle  is  not  re-\\nquired to pick up a wheelchair user when the \\nsecurement locations are full, just as the ve-\\nhicle  may  pass  by  other  passengers  waiting \\nat the stop if the bus is full. \\n\\nThe  entity  may  require  that  wheelchair \\nusers  make  use  of  securement  systems  for \\ntheir  mobility  devices.  The  entity,  in  other \\nwords,  can  require  wheelchair  users  to \\n‘‘buckle  up’’  their  mobility  devices.  The  en-\\ntity is required, on a vehicle meeting part 38 \\nstandards,  to  use  the  securement  system  to \\nsecure  wheelchairs  as  provided  in  that  part. \\nOn other vehicles (e.g., existing vehicles with \\nsecurement  systems  which  do  not  comply \\nwith part 38 standards), the entity must pro-\\nvide  and  use  a  securement  system  to  ensure \\nthat  the  mobility  device  remains  within  the \\nsecurement  area.  This  latter  requirement  is \\na  mandate  to  use  best  efforts  to  restrain  or \\nconfine  the  wheelchair  to  the  securement \\narea.  The  entity  does  the  best  it  can,  given \\nits securement technology and the nature of \\nthe  wheelchair.  The  Department  encourages \\nentities with relatively less adequate secure-\\nment  systems  on  their  vehicles,  where  fea-\\nsible,  to  retrofit  the  vehicles  with better se-\\n\\ncurement  systems,  that  can  successfully  re-\\nstrain a wide variety of wheelchairs. It is our \\nunderstanding  that  the  cost  of  doing  so  is \\nnot enormous. \\n\\nAn  entity  may  not,  in  any  case,  deny \\ntransportation  to  a  wheelchair  and  its  user \\nbecause the wheelchair cannot be secured or \\nrestrained by a vehicle’s securement system, \\nto  the  entity’s  satisfaction.  The  same  point \\napplies  to  an  OPMD  and  its  user,  subject  to \\nlegitimate safety requirements. \\n\\nEntities  have  often  recommended  or  re-\\nquired that a wheelchair user transfer out of \\nhis  or  her  own  device  into  a  vehicle  seat. \\nUnder this rule, it is no longer permissible to \\nrequire such a transfer. The entity may pro-\\nvide  information  on  risks  and  make  a  rec-\\nommendation  with  respect  to  transfer,  but \\nthe  final  decision  on  whether  to  transfer  is \\nup to the passenger. \\n\\nThe  entity’s  personnel  have  an  obligation \\nto  ensure  that  a  passenger  with  a  disability \\nis able to take advantage of the accessibility \\nand  safety \\nfeatures  on  vehicles.  Con-\\nsequently,  the  driver  or  other  personnel \\nmust provide assistance with the use of lifts, \\nramps, and securement devices. For example, \\nthe  driver  must  deploy  the  lift  properly  and \\nsafely.  If  the  passenger  cannot  do  so  inde-\\npendently,  the  driver  must  assist  the  pas-\\nsenger with using the securement device. On \\na  vehicle  which  uses  a  ramp  for  entry,  the \\ndriver may have to assist in pushing a man-\\nual  wheelchair  up  the  ramp  (particularly \\nwhere the ramp slope is relatively steep). All \\nthese  actions  may  involve  a  driver  leaving \\nhis  seat.  Even  in  entities  whose  drivers  tra-\\nditionally  do  not  leave  their  seats  (e.g.,  be-\\ncause  of  labor-management  agreements  or \\ncompany rules), this assistance must be pro-\\nvided.  This  rule  overrides  any  requirements \\nto the contrary. \\n\\nWheelchair  users,  especially  those  using \\nelectric wheelchairs, often have a preference \\nfor  entering  a  lift  platform  and  vehicle  in  a \\nparticular  direction  (e.g.,  backing  on  or \\ngoing on frontwards). Except where the only \\nway  of  successfully  maneuvering  a  device \\nonto a vehicle or into its securement area or \\nan  overriding  safety  concern  (i.e.,  a  direct \\nthreat) requires one way of doing this or an-\\nother, the transit provider should respect the \\npassenger’s  preference.  We  note  that  most \\nelectric wheelchairs are usually not equipped \\nwith  rearview  mirrors,  and  that  many  per-\\nsons  who  use  them  are  not  able  to  rotate \\ntheir heads sufficiently to see behind. People \\nusing  canes  or  walkers  and  other  standees \\nwith  disabilities  who  do  not  use  wheelchairs \\nbut have difficulty using steps (e.g., an elder-\\nly  person  who  can  walk  on  a  level  surface \\nwithout  use  of  a  mobility  aid  but  cannot \\nraise his or her legs sufficiently to climb bus \\nsteps) must also be permitted to use the lift, \\non request. \\n\\nA lift conforming to Access Board require-\\nments  has  a  platform  measuring  at  least  30″ \\n\\n520 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00530 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cOffice of the Secretary of Transportation \\n\\nPt. 37, App. D \\n\\n×  48″,  with  a  design  load  of  at  least  600 \\npounds  (i.e.,  capable  of  lifting  a  wheelchair/ \\noccupant  combination  of  up  to  600  pounds). \\nWorking  parts  upon  which  the  lift  depends \\nfor  support  of  the  load,  such  as  cables,  pul-\\nleys, and shafts, must have a safety factor of \\nat  least  six  times  the  design  load;  non-\\nworking  parts  such  as  the  platform,  frame, \\nand  attachment  hardware,  which  would  not \\nbe expected to wear, must have a safety fac-\\ntor of at least three times the design load. \\n\\nIf  a  transportation  provider  has  a  vehicle \\nand  equipment  that  meets  or  exceeds  stand-\\nards  based  on  Access  Board  guidelines,  and \\nthe vehicle and equipment can in fact safely \\naccommodate  a  given  wheelchair,  then  it  is \\nnot  appropriate,  under  disability  non-\\ndiscrimination  law,  for  the  transportation \\nprovider  to  refuse  to  transport  the  device \\nand  its  user.  Transportation  providers  must \\ncarry  a  wheelchair  and  its  user,  as  long  as \\nthe lift can accommodate the size and weight \\nof  the  wheelchair  and  its  user  and  there  is \\nspace for the wheelchair on the vehicle. How-\\never,  if  in  fact  a  lift  or  vehicle  is  unable  to \\naccommodate  the  wheelchair  and  its  user, \\nthe  transportation  provider  is  not  required \\nto carry it. \\n\\nFor  example,  suppose  that  a  bus  or  para-\\ntransit  vehicle  lift  will  safely  accommodate \\nan  800-pound  wheelchair/passenger  combina-\\ntion,  but  not  a  combination  exceeding  800 \\npounds (i.e., a design load of 800 lbs.). The lift \\nis one that exceeds the part 38 design stand-\\nard, which requires lifts to be able to accom-\\nmodate  a  600-pound  wheelchair/passenger \\ncombination.  The  transportation  provider \\ncould limit use of that lift to a combination \\nof  800  pounds  or  less.  Likewise,  if  a  wheel-\\nchair or its attachments extends beyond the \\n30  ×  48  inch  footprint  found  in  part  38’s  de-\\nsign standards but fits onto the lift and into \\nthe  wheelchair  securement  area  of  the  vehi-\\ncle,  the  transportation  provider  would  have \\nto accommodate the wheelchair. However, if \\nsuch  a  wheelchair  was  of  a  size  that  would \\nblock  an  aisle  and  interfere  with  the  safe \\nevacuation  of  passengers  in  an  emergency, \\nthe  operator  could  deny  carriage  of  that \\nwheelchair  based  on  a  legitimate  safety  re-\\nquirement. \\n\\nSection 37.167 Other Service Requirements \\n\\nThe  requirements  in  this  section  apply  to \\n\\nboth public and private entities. \\n\\nOn  fixed  route  systems,  the  entity  must \\nannounce stops. These stops include transfer \\npoints  with  other  fixed  routes.  This  means \\nthat  any  time  a  vehicle  is  to  stop  where  a \\npassenger can get off and transfer to another \\nbus or rail line (or to another form of trans-\\nportation,  such  as  commuter  rail  or  ferry), \\nthe stop would be announced. The announce-\\nment  can  be  made  personally  by  the  vehicle \\noperator  or  can  be  made  by  a  recording  sys-\\ntem.  If  the  vehicle  is  small  enough  so  that \\nthe  operator  can  make  himself  or  herself \\n\\nheard  without  a  P.A.  system,  it  is  not  nec-\\nessary to use the system. \\n\\nAnnouncements  also  must  be  made  at \\nmajor  intersections  or  destination  points. \\nThe  rule  does  not  define  what  major  inter-\\nsections  or  destination  points  are.  This  is  a \\njudgmental  matter  best  left  to  the  local \\nplanning  process.  In  addition,  the  entity \\nmust  make  announcements  at  sufficient  in-\\ntervals along a route to orient a visually im-\\npaired  passenger  to  his  or  her  location.  The \\nother  required  announcements  may  serve \\nthis function in many instances, but if there \\nis  a  long  distance  between  other  announce-\\nments,  fill-in  orientation  announcements \\nwould  be  called  for.  The  entity  must  an-\\nnounce  any  stop  requested  by  a  passenger \\nwith  a  disability,  even  if  it  does  not  meet \\nany  of  the  other  criteria  for  announcement. \\nWhen  vehicles  from  more  than  one  route \\nserve a given stop or station, the entity must \\nprovide a means to assist an individual with \\na  visual  impairment  or  other  disability  in \\ndetermining  which  is  the  proper  vehicle  to \\nenter.  Some  entities  have  used  external \\nspeakers. FTA is undertaking a study to de-\\ntermine  what  is  the  best  available  tech-\\nnology  in  this  area.  Some  transit  properties \\nhave  used  colored  mitts,  or  numbered  cards, \\nto allow passengers to inform drivers of what \\nroute they wanted to use. The idea is to pre-\\nvent, at a stop where vehicles from a number \\nof  routes  arrive,  a  person  with  a  visual  im-\\npairment  from  having  to  ask  every  driver \\nwhether  the  bus  is  the  right  one.  The  rule \\ndoes not prescribe what means is to be used, \\nonly  that  some  effective  means  be  provided. \\nService  animals  shall  always  be  permitted \\nto  accompany  their  users  in  any  private  or \\npublic transportation vehicle or facility. One \\nof  the  most  common  misunderstandings \\nabout  service  animals  is  that  they  are  lim-\\nited to being guide dogs for persons with vis-\\nual  impairments.  Dogs  are  trained  to  assist \\npeople with a wide variety of disabilities, in-\\ncluding  individuals  with  hearing  and  mobil-\\nity  impairments.  Other  animals  (e.g.,  mon-\\nkeys) are sometimes used as service animals \\nas well. In any of these situations, the entity \\nmust  permit  the  service  animal  to  accom-\\npany its user. \\n\\nPart  38  requires  a  variety  of  accessibility \\nequipment. This section requires that the en-\\ntity  use  the  equipment  it  has.  For  example, \\nit  would  be  contrary  to  this  provision  for  a \\ntransit authority to bolt its bus lifts shut be-\\ncause  transit  authority  had  difficulty  main-\\ntaining  the  lifts.  It  does  little  good  to  have \\na  public  address  system  on  a  vehicle  if  the \\noperator  does  not  use  it  to  make  announce-\\nments  (except,  as  noted  above,  in  the  situa-\\ntion  where  the  driver  can  make  himself  or \\nherself  heard  without  recourse  to  amplifi-\\ncation.) \\n\\nEntities  must  make  communications  and \\ninformation  available,  using  accessible  for-\\nmats  and  technology  (e.g.,  Braille,  large \\n\\n521 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00531 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cPt. 37, App. D \\n\\n49 CFR Subtitle A (10–1–21 Edition) \\n\\nprint,  TDDs)  to  obtain  information  about \\ntransportation  services.  Someone  cannot \\nadequately  use  the  bus  system  if  schedule \\nand  route  information  is  not  available  in  a \\nform  he  or  she  can  use.  If  there  is  only  one \\nphone line on which ADA paratransit eligible \\nindividuals  can  reserve  trips,  and  the  line  is \\nchronically  busy,  individuals  cannot  sched-\\nule  service.  Such  obstacles  to  the  use  of \\ntransportation  service  are  contrary  to  this \\nsection.  (The  latter  could,  in  some  cir-\\ncumstances,  be  viewed  as  a  capacity  con-\\nstraint.) \\n\\nIt  is  inconsistent  with  this  section  for  a \\ntransit  provider  to  refuse  to  let  a  passenger \\nuse  a  lift  at  any  designated  stop,  unless  the \\nlift is physically unable to deploy or the lift \\nwould  be  damaged  if  it  did  deploy  (see  dis-\\ncussion  under  § 37.123).  In  addition,  if  a  tem-\\nporary  situation  at  the  stop  (e.g.,  construc-\\ntion, an accident, a landslide) made the stop \\nunsafe  for  anyone  to  use,  the  provider  could \\ndecline to operate the lift there (just as it re-\\nfused  to  open  the  door  for  other  passengers \\nat  the  same  point).  The  provider  could  not, \\nhowever,  declare  a  stop  ‘‘off  limits’’  to  per-\\nsons  with  disabilities  that  is  used  for  other \\npersons.  If  the  transit  authority  has  con-\\ncerns  about  barriers  or  safety  hazards  that \\npeculiarly affect individuals with disabilities \\nthat  would  use  the  stop,  it  should  consider \\nmaking efforts to move the stop. \\n\\nUnder  DOT  hazardous  materials  rules,  a \\npassenger may bring a portable medical oxy-\\ngen supply on board a vehicle. Since the haz-\\nardous  materials  rules  permit  this,  transit \\nproviders  cannot  prohibit  it.  For  further  in-\\nformation  on  hazardous  materials  rules,  as \\nthey  may  affect  transportation  of  assistive \\ndevices,  entities  may  contact  the  Depart-\\nment’s  Research  and  Special  Programs  Ad-\\nministration,  Office  of  Hazardous  Materials \\nTransportation (202–366–0656). \\n\\nOne  concern  that  has  been  expressed  is \\nthat  transportation  systems  (particularly \\nsome rail systems) may make it difficult for \\npersons  with  disabilities  to  board  or  dis-\\nembark from vehicles by very rapidly closing \\ndoors on the vehicles before individuals with \\ndisabilities  (who  may  move  more  slowly \\nthrough  crowds  in  the  vehicle  or  platform \\nthan  other  persons)  have  a  chance  to  get  on \\nor off the vehicle. Doing so is contrary to the \\nrule; operators must make appropriate provi-\\nsion to give individuals with disabilities ade-\\nquate time to board or disembark. \\n\\nSection  37.169\\n\\nInterim  Requirements  for  Over- \\nthe-Road Bus Service Operated by Private En-\\ntities \\n\\nPrivate  over-the-road  bus  (OTRB)  service \\nis, first of all, subject to all the other private \\nentity requirements of the rule. The require-\\nments  of  this  section  are  in  addition  to  the \\nother applicable provisions. \\n\\nBoarding  assistance  is  required.  The  De-\\npartment  cannot  require  any  particular \\n\\nboarding  assistance  devices  at  this  time. \\nEach  operator  may  decide  what  mode  of \\nboarding assistance is appropriate for its op-\\neration.  We  agree  with  the  discussion  in  the \\nDOJ Title II rule’s preamble that carrying is \\na  disfavored  method  of  providing  assistance \\nto  an  individual  with  a  disability.  However, \\nsince accessible private OTRBs cannot be re-\\nquired by this rule, there may be times when \\ncarrying  is  the  only  available  means  of  pro-\\nviding access to an OTRB, if the entity does \\nnot  exercise  its  discretion  to  provide  an  al-\\nternative  means.  It  is  required  by  the  rule \\nthat any employee who provides boarding as-\\nsistance—above all, who may carry or other-\\nwise  directly  physically  assist  a  passenger— \\nmust  be  trained  to  provide  this  assistance \\nappropriately and safely. \\n\\nThe  baggage  priority  provision  for  wheel-\\nchairs  and  other  assistive  devices  involves  a \\nsimilar  procedure  to  that  established  in  the \\nDepartment’s Air Carrier Access Act rule (14 \\nCFR  part  382).  In  brief,  it  provides  that,  at \\nany given stop, a person with a wheelchair or \\nother  assistive  device  would  have  the  device \\nloaded before other items at this stop. An in-\\ndividual  traveling  with  a  wheelchair  is  not \\nsimilarly situated to a person traveling with \\nluggage. For the wheelchair user, the wheel-\\nchair  is  an  essential  mobility  device,  with-\\nout which travel is impossible. The rationale \\nof this provision is that, while no one wants \\nhis  or  her  items  left  behind,  carrying  the \\nwheelchair  is  more  important  to  its  user \\nthan  ordinary  luggage  to  a  traveler.  If  it \\ncomes to an either/or choice (the wheelchair \\nuser’s  luggage  would  not  have  any  priority \\nover other luggage, however). There would be \\nno  requirement,  under  this  provision,  for \\n‘‘bumping’’ baggage already on the bus from \\nprevious stops in order to make room for the \\nwheelchair. \\n\\nThe  entity  could  require  advance  notice \\nfrom  a  passenger  in  only  one  circumstance. \\nIf  a  passenger  needed  boarding  assistance, \\nthe  entity  could  require  up  to  48  hours’  ad-\\nvance  notice  for  the  purpose  of  providing \\nneeded  assistance.  While  advance  notice  re-\\nquirements  are  generally  undesirable,  this \\nappears  to  be  a  case  in  which  a  needed  ac-\\ncommodation  may  be  able  to  be  provided \\nsuccessfully  only  if  the  transportation  pro-\\nvider  knows  in  advance  that  some  extra \\nstaffing is needed to accomplish it. While the \\nprimary  need  for  advance  notice  appears  to \\nbe  in  the  situation  of  an  unstaffed  station, \\nthere  could  be  other  situations  in  which  ad-\\nvance  notice  was  needed  in  order  to  ensure \\nthat the accommodation could be made. En-\\ntities  should  not  ask  for  advance  notice  in \\nall  cases,  but  just  in  those  cases  in  which  it \\nis really needed for this purpose. Even if ad-\\nvance  notice  is  not  provided,  the  entity  has \\nthe obligation to provide boarding assistance \\nif it can be provided with available staff. \\n\\n522 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00532 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cOffice of the Secretary of Transportation \\n\\nPt. 37, App. D \\n\\nSection  37.171 Equivalency  Requirement  for \\nDemand  Responsive  Service  Operated  by  Pri-\\nvate Entities Not Primarily in the Business of \\nTransporting People \\n\\nThis  provision  is  a  service  requirement \\nclosely related to the private entity require-\\nments for §§ 37.101–37.105 of this part.

The  utility  of  training  was  rec-\\nognized  by  Congress  as  well.  (See  S.  Rept. \\n100–116  at  48.)  At  the  same  time,  we  believe \\nthat training should be conducted in an effi-\\ncient and effective manner, with appropriate \\nflexibility  allowed  to  the  organizations  that \\nmust  carry  it  out.  Each  transportation  pro-\\nvider  is  to  design  a  training  program  which \\nsuits  the  needs  of  its  particular  operation. \\nWhile  we  are  confident  of  this  approach,  we \\nare  mindful  that  the  apparent  lack  of  train-\\ning  has  been  a  source  of  complaint  to  FTA \\nand  transit  providers.  Good  training  is  dif-\\nficult and it is essential. \\n\\nSeveral  points  of  this  section  deserve  em-\\nphasis.  First,  the  requirements  for  training \\napply  to  private  as  well  as  to  public  pro-\\nviders,  of  demand  responsive  as  well  as  of \\nfixed  route  service.  Training  is  just  as  nec-\\nessary  for  the  driver  of  a  taxicab,  a  hotel \\nshuttle,  or  a  tour  bus  as  it  is  for  a  driver  in \\nan FTA-funded city bus system. \\n\\nSecond,  training  must  be  to  proficiency. \\nThe  Department  is  not  requiring  a  specific \\ncourse  of  training  or  the  submission  of  a \\ntraining  plan  for  DOT  approval.  However, \\nevery  employee  of  a  transportation  provider \\nwho is involved with service to persons with \\ndisabilities  must  have  been  trained  so  that \\nhe  or  she  knows  what  needs  to  be  done  to \\nprovide the service in the right way. When it \\ncomes  to  providing  service  to  individuals \\nwith  disabilities,  ignorance  is  no  excuse  for \\nfailure. \\n\\nWhile  there  is  no  specific  requirement  for \\nrecurrent  or  refresher  training,  there  is  an \\nobligation to ensure that, at any given time, \\nemployees are trained to proficiency. An em-\\nployee who has forgotten what he was told in \\npast training sessions, so that he or she does \\nnot know what needs to be done to serve in-\\n\\ndividuals with disabilities, does not meet the \\nstandard of being trained to proficiency. \\n\\nThird, training must be appropriate to the \\nduties  of  each  employee.  A  paratransit  dis-\\npatcher  probably  must  know  how  to  use  a \\nTDD  and  enough  about  various  disabilities \\nto  know  what  sort  of  vehicle  to  dispatch.  A \\nbus  driver  must  know  how  to  operate  lifts \\nand  securement  devices  properly.  A  me-\\nchanic who works on lifts must know how to \\nmaintain  them.  Cross-training,  while  useful \\nin some instances, is not required, so long as \\neach  employee  is  trained  to  proficiency  in \\nwhat  he  or  she  does  with  respect  to  service \\nto individuals with disabilities. \\n\\nFourth,  the  training  requirement  goes \\nboth to technical tasks and human relations. \\nEmployees  obviously  need  to  know  how  to \\nrun equipment the right way. If an employee \\nwill  be  assisting  wheelchair  users  in  trans-\\nferring  from  a  wheelchair  to  a  vehicle  seat, \\nthe  employee  needs  training  in  how  to  do \\nthis  safely.  But  every  public  contact  em-\\nployee  also  has  to  understand  the  necessity \\nof treating individuals with disabilities cour-\\nteously  and  respectfully,  and  the  details  of \\nwhat that involves. \\n\\nOne  of  the  best  sources  of  information  on \\nhow  best  to  train  personnel  to  interact  ap-\\npropriately with individuals with disabilities \\nis  the  disability  community  itself.  Con-\\nsequently,  the  Department  urges  entities  to \\nconsult  with  disability  organizations  con-\\ncerning how to train their personnel. Involv-\\ning  these  groups  in  the  process  of  estab-\\nlishing training programs, in addition to pro-\\nviding useful information, should help to es-\\ntablish  or  improve  working  relationships \\namong  transit  providers  and  disability \\ngroups that, necessarily, will be of long dura-\\ntion.  We  note  that  several  transit  providers \\nuse  persons  with  disabilities  to  provide  the \\nactual  training.  Others  have  reported  that \\nrole playing is an effective method to instill \\nan appreciation of the particular perspective \\nof one traveling with a disability. \\n\\nFinally,  one  of  the  important  points  in \\ntraining concerns differences among individ-\\nuals  with  disabilities.  All  individuals  with \\ndisabilities, of course, are not alike. The ap-\\npropriate  ways  one  deals  with  persons  with \\nvarious  kinds  of  disabilities  (e.g.,  mobility, \\nvision,  hearing,  or  mental  impairments)  are \\nlikely to differ and, while no one expects bus \\ndrivers to be trained as disability specialists, \\nrecognizing relevant differences and respond-\\ning  to  them  appropriately  is  extremely  sig-\\nnificant.  Public  entities  who  contract  with \\nprivate  entities  to  have  service  provided— \\nabove  all,  complementary  paratransit—are \\nresponsible for ensuring that contractor per-\\nsonnel receive the appropriate training. \\n\\n523 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00533 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cPt. 37, App. D \\n\\n49 CFR Subtitle A (10–1–21 Edition) \\n\\nAppendix A to Part 37—Standards for Accessible \\nTransportation Facilities \\n\\nSections  504(a)  and  (b)  of  the  Americans \\nwith  Disabilities  Act  (ADA)  require  the  Ac-\\ncess  Board  to  adopt  accessibility  guidelines; \\nsections  204(c)  and  306(c)  of  the  ADA  require \\nthe  Department  of  Transportation  to  adopt \\nregulatory  standards  ‘‘consistent  with  the \\nminimum  guidelines  and  requirements’’ \\nissued  by  the  Access  Board.  In  the  original \\n1991  publication  of  part  37,  the  Department \\ncomplied with this requirement by reproduc-\\ning  the  Access  Board’s  Americans  with  Dis-\\nabilities  Act  Accessibility  Guidelines \\n(ADAAG) in their entirety as Appendix A. \\n\\nThe  Access  Board  revised  ADAAG  in  July \\n2004.  ADAAG,  including  technical  amend-\\nments  issued  in  July  2005,  is  codified  in  Ap-\\npendices  B  and  D  to  36  CFR  part  1191.  In \\norder  to  avoid  duplication  of  material  that \\nthe Access Board has already included in the \\nCFR,  and  which  is  now  readily  available  on \\nthe  Internet,  the  Department  has  adopted \\nADAAG  by  cross-reference  in  part  37,  rather \\nthan  reproducing  the  lengthy  Access  Board \\npublication.  However,  there  are  certain  pro-\\nvisions  of  ADAAG  that  the  Department  is \\nmodifying  for  clarity  or  to  preserve  require-\\nments that have been in effect under the ex-\\nisting standards. Under the ADA, the Depart-\\nment,  in  adopting  standards,  has  the  discre-\\ntion  to  depart  from  the  language  of  ADAAG \\nas  long  as  the  Department’s  standards  re-\\nmain  consistent  with  the  Access  Board’s \\nminimum guidelines. In addition, this appen-\\ndix  provides  additional  guidance  concerning \\nsome  sections  of  the  DOT  standards  as  they \\napply to transportation facilities. \\n\\nSection 201.1 \\n\\nThe basic scoping requirement requires all \\nareas  of  newly  designed  and  newly  con-\\nstructed  buildings  and  facilities  to  be  acces-\\nsible. Former § 4.1.1(5) provided a ‘‘structural \\nimpracticability’’  exception  to  the  require-\\nments  for  new  buildings  and  facilities.  The \\nAccess Board deleted this exception to avoid \\nduplication  with  an  existing  requirement  to \\nthe  same  effect  in  Department  of  Justice \\nregulations  (see  28  CFR  § 36.401(c)).  For  con-\\nsistency with the approach taken by the Ac-\\ncess  Board  and  Department  of  Justice,  and \\nto ensure consistency between facilities sub-\\nject  to  Titles  II  and  III  of  the  ADA  under \\npart  37,  the  Department  has  added  the  lan-\\nguage  of  the  Department  of  Justice  regula-\\ntion to § 37.41 of this part. \\n\\nSection 206.3 \\n\\nThis  section  concerns  the  location  of  ac-\\ncessible  paths.  The  Department  is  retaining \\nlanguage  from  former  § 10.3.1(1),  which  pro-\\nvides  that  ‘‘Elements  such  as  ramps,  ele-\\nvators,  or  other  circulation  devices,  fare \\nvending  or  other  ticketing  areas,  and  fare \\ncollection  areas  shall  be  placed  to  minimize \\n\\nthe  distance  which  wheelchair  users  and \\nother  persons  who  cannot  negotiate  steps \\nmay  have  to  travel  compared  to  the  general \\npublic.’’  This  concept,  in  our  view,  is  im-\\nplicit  in  the  language  of  § 206.3.  However,  we \\nbelieve it is useful to make explicit the con-\\ncept that, in transportation facilities such as \\nrail stations, important facility elements are \\nplaced  so  as  to  minimize  the  distance  per-\\nsons  with  disabilities  must  travel  to  use \\nthem. This requirement is intended to affect \\ndecisions  about  where  to  locate  entrances, \\nboarding  locations  (e.g.,  where  a  mini-high \\nplatform is used for boarding), and other key \\nelements of a facility. \\n\\nSection 406.8 \\n\\nTo maintain the status quo with respect to \\ndetectable  warnings  in  pedestrian  facilities, \\nthe  Department  is  adding  a  provision  (not \\nfound  in  the  current  version  of  the  new \\nADAAG)  requiring  curb  ramps  to  have  de-\\ntectable warnings. \\n\\nSection 810.2.2 \\n\\nThe Department recognizes that there will \\nbe  some  situations  in  which  the  full  dimen-\\nsions  of  a  bus  boarding  and  alighting  area \\ncomplying  with  the  § 810.2.2  may  not  be  able \\nto  be  achieved  (e.g.,  there  is  less  than  96 \\ninches of perpendicular space available from \\nthe  curb  or  roadway  edge,  because  of  build-\\nings  or  terrain  features).  The  Department  is \\nadding language from former § 37.9 (c) of this \\npart,  which  provides  that  ‘‘Public  entities \\nshall ensure the construction of bus boarding \\nand  alighting  areas  comply  with  810.2.2,  to \\nthe  extent  the  construction  specifications \\nare  within  their  control.’’  Where  it  is  not \\nfeasible to fully comply with § 810.2.2, the De-\\npartment expects compliance to the greatest \\nextent feasible. \\n\\nWe note that there may be some instances \\nin  which  it  will  be  necessary  to  make  oper-\\national  adjustments  where  sufficient  clear-\\nance  is  not  available  to  permit  the  deploy-\\nment of lifts or ramps on vehicles. For exam-\\nple,  a  bus  driver  could  position  the  bus  at  a \\nnearby  point—even  if  not  the  precise  loca-\\ntion  of  the  designated  stop—so  that  a  pas-\\nsenger needing a lift or ramp to get on or off \\nthe bus can do so. To avoid the need for such \\noperational  adjustments,  it  is  important  to \\nplace bus shelters, signs, etc. so that they do \\nnot intrude into the required clearances. \\n\\nSection 810.5.3 \\n\\nThis  section  concerns  coordination  be-\\ntween  rail  platforms  and  rail  vehicles.  The \\nDepartment  is  adding  language  from  the \\nformer  § 10.3.1  (9)  (Exception  2),  which  pro-\\nvides that ‘‘In light rail, commuter rail, and \\nintercity  rail  systems  where  it  is  not  oper-\\nationally or structurally feasible to meet the \\nhorizontal gap or vertical difference require-\\nments,  mini-high  platforms,  car-borne  or \\n\\n524 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00534 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cOffice of the Secretary of Transportation \\n\\nPt. 37, App. E \\n\\nplatform-mounted  lifts,  ramps  or  bridge \\nplates  or  similarly  manually  deployed  de-\\nvices,  meeting  the  requirements  of  49  CFR \\nPart 38 shall be permitted.’’ \\n\\nIn  September  2005,  the  Department  issued \\nguidance  concerning  the  relationship  of  its \\nADA and 504 rules in the context of rail plat-\\nform  accessibility  This  guidance emphasized \\nthat  access  to  all  cars  of  a  train  is  signifi-\\ncant  because,  if  passengers  with  disabilities \\nare  unable  to  enter  all  cars  from  the  plat-\\nform, the passengers will have access only to \\nsegregated  service.  This  would  be  incon-\\nsistent  with  the  nondiscrimination  mandate \\nof the ADA. It would also, in the case of Fed-\\neral  Transit  Administration  (FTA)  and  Fed-\\neral  Railroad  Administration  (FRA)-assisted \\nprojects  (including  Amtrak),  be  inconsistent \\nwith  the  requirement  of  the  Department’s \\nsection  504  regulation  (49  CFR  § 27.7),  which \\nrequires  service  in  the  most  integrated  set-\\nting  reasonably  achievable.  This  guidance \\nstates  the  Department’s  views  of  the  mean-\\ning of its existing rules, and the Department \\nwill  continue  to  use  this  guidance  in  apply-\\ning the provisions of this rule. \\n\\nThe  Department  notes  that  a  related  sec-\\ntion of 49 CFR part 38 has been the source of \\nsome  misunderstanding.  Section  38.71(b)(2) \\nprovides that ‘‘Vehicles designed for, and op-\\nerated  on,  pedestrian  malls,  city  streets,  or \\nother areas where level-entry boarding is not \\npracticable  shall  provide  wayside  or  car- \\nborne  lifts,  mini-high  platforms,  or  other \\nmeans of access in compliance with § 38.83 (b) \\nor  (c)  of  this  part.’’  The  Department  has  re-\\nceived  some  suggestions  that  this  provision \\nshould  be  interpreted  to  mean  that,  if  there \\nis  any  portion  of  a  system  in  which  level- \\nentry  boarding  is  not  practicable,  then  the \\nentire  system  can  use  some  method  other \\nthan  level-entry boarding. Such  an interpre-\\ntation  is  incorrect.  The  authority  to  use  al-\\nternatives  to  level-entry  boarding  pertains \\nonly  to  those  portions  of  a  system  in  which \\nrail  vehicles  are  ‘‘operated  on’’  an  area \\nwhere  level-entry  boarding  is  not  prac-\\nticable. \\n\\nFor  example,  suppose  a  light  rail  system’s \\nfirst  three  stops  are  on  a  pedestrian/transit \\nmall  where  it  is  infeasible  to  provide  level- \\nentry boarding. The transit system could use \\ncar-borne  lifts,  mini-high  platforms,  etc.  to \\nprovide access at those three stops. The sys-\\ntem’s  next  ten  stops  are  part  of  a  right-of- \\nway  in  which  level-entry  boarding  is  prac-\\nticable.  In  such  a  case,  level-entry  boarding \\nwould have to be provided at those ten stops. \\nThere  is  nothing  inappropriate  about  the \\nsame  system  having  different  means  of \\nboarding  in  different  locations,  in  such  a \\ncase. \\n\\nWe  also  caution  against  a  potential  mis-\\nunderstanding  of  the  sentence  in  § 810.5.3 \\n‘‘Low-level  platforms \\nthat  provides  that \\nshall  be  8  inches  minimum  (205  mm)  above \\ntop  of  rail.’’  This  does  not  mean  that  high- \\n\\nlevel  platforms  are  prohibited  or  that  low- \\nlevel  platforms  are  the  only  design  con-\\nsistent  with  the  rules.  It  simply  means  that \\nwhere low-level platforms are otherwise per-\\nmitted,  such  platforms  must  be  at  least  8 \\ninches above the top of rail, except where ve-\\nhicles  are  boarded  from  the  street  or  a  side-\\nwalk. \\n\\n[56  FR  45621,  Sept.  6,  1991,  as  amended  at  61 \\nFR  25416,  May  21,  1996;  71  FR  63266,  Oct.  30, \\n2006;  76  FR  57936,  Sept.  19,  2011;  79  FR  21406, \\nApr. 16, 2014] \\n\\nAPPENDIX E TO PART 37—REASONABLE \\nMODIFICATION REQUESTS \\n\\nA.  This  appendix  explains  the  Depart-\\nment’s  interpretation  of  §§ 37.5(i)  and  37.169. \\nIt is intended to be used as the official posi-\\ntion  of  the  Department  concerning  the \\nmeaning and implementation of these provi-\\nsions.  The  Department  also  issues  guidance \\nby  other  means,  as  provided  in  § 37.15.  The \\nDepartment  also  may  update  this  appendix \\nperiodically,  provided  in  response  to  inquir-\\nies about specific situations that are of gen-\\neral relevance or interest. \\n\\nB. The Department’s ADA regulations con-\\ntain  numerous  requirements  concerning \\nfixed route, complementary paratransit, and \\nother types of transportation service. Trans-\\nformulate \\nportation  entities  necessarily \\npolicies and practices to meet these require-\\nments (e.g., providing fixed route bus service \\nthat people with disabilities can use to move \\namong  stops  on  the  system,  providing  com-\\nplementary paratransit service that gets eli-\\ngible  riders  from  their  point  of  origin  to \\ntheir  point  of  destination).  There  may  be \\ncertain  situations,  however,  in  which  the \\notherwise  reasonable  policies  and  practices \\nof entities do not suffice to achieve the regu-\\nlation’s  objectives.  Implementing  a  fixed \\nroute bus policy in the normal way may not \\nallow a passenger with a disability to access \\nand  use  the  system  at  a  particular  location. \\nImplementing  a  paratransit  policy  in  the \\nusual way may not allow a rider to get from \\nhis or her origin to his or her destination. In \\nthese  situations,  subject  to  the  limitations \\ndiscussed  below,  the  transportation  provider \\nmust  make  reasonable  modifications  of  its \\nservice  in  order  to  comply  with  the  under-\\nlying requirements of the rule. These under-\\nlying  provisions  tell  entities  the  end  they \\nmust  achieve;  the  reasonable  modification \\nprovision  tells  entities  how  to  achieve  that \\nend  in  situations  in  which  normal  policies \\nand practices do not succeed in doing so. \\n\\nC. As noted above, the responsibility of en-\\ntities  to  make  requested  reasonable  modi-\\nfications  is  not  without  some  limitations. \\nThere are four classes of situations in which \\na  request  may  legitimately  be  denied.  The \\nfirst  is  where  granting  the  request  would \\nfundamentally  alter  the  entity’s  services, \\n\\n525 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00535 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cPt. 37, App. E \\n\\n49 CFR Subtitle A (10–1–21 Edition) \\n\\nprograms,  or  activities.  The  second  is  where \\ngranting  the  request  would  create  a  direct \\nthreat to the health or safety of others. The \\nthird  is  where  without  the  requested  modi-\\nfication,  the  individual  with  a  disability  is \\nable  to  fully  use  the  entity’s  services,  pro-\\ngrams,  or  activities  for  their  intended  pur-\\npose.  The  fourth,  which  applies  only  to  re-\\ncipients  of  Federal  financial  assistance,  is \\nwhere  granting  the  request  would  cause  an \\nundue  financial  and  administrative  burden. \\nIn  the  examples  that  follow,  these  limita-\\ntions are taken into account. \\n\\nD.  The  examples  included  in  this  appendix \\nare  neither  exhaustive  nor  exclusive.  Trans-\\nportation  entities  may  need  to  make  deter-\\nminations  about  requests  for  reasonable \\nmodification  that  are  not  described  in  this \\nappendix.  Importantly,  reasonable  modifica-\\ntion  applies  to  an  entities’  own  policies  and \\npractices,  and  not  regulatory  requirements \\ncontained  in  49  CFR  parts  27,  37,  38,  and  39, \\nsuch  as  complementary  paratransit  service \\ngoing beyond  3⁄4 mile of the fixed route, pro-\\nviding  same  day  complementary  paratransit \\nservice, etc. \\n\\nEXAMPLES \\n\\n1.  Snow  and  Ice.  Except  in  extreme  condi-\\ntions that rise to the level of a direct threat \\nto the driver or others, a passenger’s request \\nfor a paratransit driver to walk over a path-\\nway  that  has  not  been  fully  cleared  of  snow \\nand  ice  should  be  granted  so  that  the  driver \\ncan  help  the  passenger  with  a  disability \\nnavigate the pathway. For example, ambula-\\ntory blind passengers often have difficulty in \\nicy conditions, and allowing the passenger to \\ntake  the  driver’s  arm  will  increase  both  the \\nspeed  and  safety  of  the  passenger’s  walk \\nfrom  the  door  to  the  vehicle.  Likewise,  if \\nsnow or icy conditions at a bus stop make it \\ndifficult  or  impossible  for  a  fixed  route  pas-\\nsenger with a disability to get to a lift, or for \\nthe lift to deploy, the driver should move the \\nbus to a cleared area for boarding, if such is \\navailable within reasonable proximity to the \\nstop (see Example 4 below). \\n\\n2. Pick Up and Drop Off Locations with Mul-\\ntiple  Entrances.  A  paratransit  rider’s  request \\nto be picked up at home, but not at the front \\ndoor  of  his  or  her  home,  should  be  granted, \\nas  long  as  the  requested  pick-up  location \\ndoes  not  pose  a  direct  threat.  Similarly,  in \\nthe  case  of  frequently  visited  public  places \\nwith  multiple  entrances \\n(e.g.,  shopping \\nmalls,  employment  centers,  schools,  hos-\\npitals,  airports),  the  paratransit  operator \\nshould pick up and drop off the passenger at \\nthe  entrance  requested  by  the  passenger, \\nrather than meet them in a location that has \\nbeen  predetermined  by  the  transportation \\nagency,  again  assuming  that  doing  so  does \\nnot involve a direct threat. \\n\\n3.  Private  Property.  Paratransit  passengers \\nmay sometimes  seek  to  be picked  up  on  pri-\\nvate property (e.g., in a gated community or \\n\\nparking  lot,  mobile  home  community,  busi-\\nness  or  government  facility  where  vehicle \\naccess requires authorized passage through a \\nsecurity barrier). Even if the paratransit op-\\nerator  does  not  generally  have  a  policy  of \\npicking  up  passengers  on  such  private  prop-\\nerty,  the  paratransit  operator  should  make \\nevery  reasonable  effort  to  gain  access  to \\nsuch  an  area  (e.g.,  work  with  the  passenger \\nto  get  the  permission  of  the  property  owner \\nto permit access for the paratransit vehicle). \\nThe  paratransit  operator  is  not  required  to \\nviolate  the  law  or  lawful  access  restrictions \\nto meet the passenger’s requests. A public or \\nprivate  entity  that  unreasonably  denies  ac-\\ncess  to  a  paratransit  vehicle  may  be  subject \\nto  a  complaint  to  the  U.S.  Department  of \\nJustice  or  U.S.  Department  of  Housing  and \\nUrban  Development \\nfor  discriminating \\nagainst services for persons with disabilities. \\n4.  Obstructions.  For  fixed  route  services,  a \\npassenger’s  request  for  a  driver  to  position \\nthe vehicle to avoid obstructions to the pas-\\nsenger’s ability to enter or leave the vehicle \\nat a designated stop location, such as parked \\ncars,  snow  banks,  and  construction,  should \\nbe granted so long as positioning the vehicle \\nto  avoid  the  obstruction  does  not  pose  a  di-\\nrect  threat.  To  be  granted,  such  a  request \\nshould  result  in  the  vehicle  stopping  in  rea-\\nsonably  close  proximity  to  the  designated \\nstop  location.  Transportation  entities  are \\nnot  required  to  pick  up  passengers  with  dis-\\nabilities  at  nondesignated  locations.  Fixed \\nroute  operators  would  not  have  to  establish \\nflag stop or route-deviation policies, as these \\nwould  be  fundamental  alterations  to  a  fixed \\nroute  system  rather  than  reasonable  modi-\\nfications  of  a  system.  Likewise,  subject  to \\nthe limitations discussed in the introduction \\nto  this  appendix,  paratransit  operators \\nshould be flexible in establishing pick up and \\ndrop off points to avoid obstructions. \\n\\n5.  Fare  Handling.  A  passenger’s  request  for \\ntransit personnel (e.g., the driver, station at-\\ntendant)  to  handle  the  fare  media  when  the \\npassenger  with  a  disability  cannot  pay  the \\nfare  by  the  generally  established  means \\nshould  be  granted  on  fixed  route  or  para-\\ntransit  service  (e.g.,  in  a  situation  where  a \\nbus  passenger  cannot  reach  or  insert  a  fare \\ninto  the  farebox).  Transit  personnel  are  not \\nrequired  to  reach  into  pockets  or  backpacks \\nin order to extract the fare media. \\n\\n6.  Eating  and  Drinking.  If  a  passenger  with \\ndiabetes  or  another  medical  condition  re-\\nquests to eat or drink aboard a vehicle or in \\na  transit  facility  in  order  to  avoid  adverse \\nhealth  consequences,  the  request  should  be \\ngranted,  even  if  the  transportation  provider \\nhas  a  policy  that  prohibits  eating  or  drink-\\ning.  For  example,  a  person  with  diabetes \\nmay  need  to  consume  a  small  amount  of  or-\\nange  juice  in  a  closed  container  or  a  candy \\nbar  in  order  to  maintain  blood  sugar  levels. \\n7.  Medicine.  A  passenger’s  request  to  take \\nmedication  while  aboard  a  fixed  route  or \\n\\n526 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00536 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cOffice of the Secretary of Transportation \\n\\nPt. 37, App. E \\n\\nparatransit  vehicle  or  in  a  transit  facility \\nshould  be  granted.  For  example,  transit \\nagencies  should  modify  their  policies  to \\nallow individuals to administer insulin injec-\\ntions  and  conduct  finger  stick  blood  glucose \\ntesting.  Transit  staff  need  not  provide  med-\\nical  assistance,  however,  as  this  would  be  a \\nfundamental alteration of their function. \\n\\n8.  Boarding  Separately  From  Wheelchair.  A \\nwheelchair  user’s  request  to  board  a  fixed \\nroute  or  paratransit  vehicle  separately  from \\nhis or her device when the occupied weight of \\nthe device exceeds the design load of the ve-\\nhicle lift should generally be granted. (Note, \\nhowever,  that  under  § 37.165(b),  entities  are \\nrequired  to  accommodate  device/user  loads \\nand  dimensions  that  exceed  the  former \\n‘‘common  wheelchair’’  standard,  as  long  as \\nthe vehicle and lift will accommodate them.) \\n9. Dedicated vehicles or special equipment in a \\nvehicle. A paratransit passenger’s request for \\nspecial  equipment  (e.g.,  the  installation  of \\nspecific hand rails or a front seat in a vehicle \\nfor  the  passenger  to  avoid  nausea  or  back \\npain)  can  be  denied  so  long  as  the  requested \\nequipment  is  not  required  by  the  Americans \\nwith  Disabilities  Act  or  the  Department’s \\nrules. Likewise, a request for a dedicated ve-\\nhicle  (e.g.,  to  avoid  residual  chemical  odors) \\nor  a  specific  type  or  appearance  of  vehicle \\n(e.g.,  a  sedan  rather  than  a  van,  in  order  to \\nprovide more comfortable service) can be de-\\nnied.  In  all  of  these  cases,  the  Department \\nviews meeting the request as involving a fun-\\ndamental  alteration  of  the  provider’s  serv-\\nice. \\n\\n10. Exclusive or Reduced Capacity Paratransit \\nTrips.  A  passenger’s  request  for  an  exclusive \\nparatransit  trip  may  be  denied  as  a  funda-\\nmental  alteration  of  the  entity’s  services. \\nParatransit  is  by  nature  a  shared-ride  serv-\\nice. \\n\\n11.  Outside  of  the  Service  Area  or  Operating \\nHours.  A  person’s  request  for  fixed  route  or \\nparatransit service may be denied when hon-\\noring the request would require the transpor-\\ntation  provider  to  travel  outside  of  its  serv-\\nice area or to operate outside of its operating \\nhours.  This  request  would  not  be  a  reason-\\nable  modification  because  it  would  con-\\nstitute a fundamental alteration of the enti-\\nty’s service. \\n\\n12.  Personal  Care  Attendant  (PCA).  While \\nPCAs  may  travel  with  a  passenger  with  a \\ndisability,  transportation  agencies  are  not \\nrequired to provide a personal care attendant \\nor  personal  care  attendant  services  to  meet \\nthe  needs  of  passengers  with  disabilities  on \\nparatransit or fixed route trips. For example, \\na  passenger’s  request  for  a  transportation \\nentity’s driver to remain with the passenger \\nwho,  due  to  his  or  her  disability,  cannot  be \\nleft  alone  without  an  attendant  upon  reach-\\ning  his  or  her  destination  may  be  denied.  It \\nwould  be  a  fundamental  alteration  of  the \\ndriver’s  function  to  provide  PCA  services  of \\nthis kind. \\n\\n13.  Intermediate  Stops.  The  Department \\nviews  granting  a  paratransit  passenger’s  re-\\nquest  for  a  driver  to  make  an  intermediate \\nstop,  where  the  driver  would  be  required  to \\nwait,  as  optional.  For  example,  a  passenger \\nwith a disability arranges to be picked up at \\na  medical  facility  and  dropped  off  at  home. \\nOn  the  way,  the  passenger  with  a  disability \\nwishes  to  stop  by  a  pharmacy  and  requests \\nthat  the  driver  park  outside  of  the  phar-\\nmacy,  wait  for  the  passenger  to  return,  and \\nthen  continue  the  ride  home.  While  this  can \\nbe  a  very  useful  service  to  the  rider,  and  in \\nsome  cases  can  save  the  provider’s  time  and \\nmoney  (by  scheduling  and  providing  a  sepa-\\nrate trip to and from the drug store), such a \\nstop in the context of a shared ride system is \\nnot required. Since paratransit is, by its na-\\nture,  a  shared  ride  system,  requests  that \\ncould  disrupt  schedules  and  inconvenience \\nother  passengers  could  rise  to  the  level  of  a \\nfundamental alteration. \\n\\n14.  Payment.  A  passenger’s  request  for  a \\nfixed  route  or  paratransit  driver  to  provide \\nthe  transit  service  when  the  passenger  with \\na disability cannot or refuses to pay the fare \\nmay  be  denied.  If  the  transportation  agency \\nrequires  payment  to  ride,  then  to  provide  a \\nfree  service  would  constitute  a  fundamental \\nalteration of the entity’s service. \\n\\n15. Caring for Service Animals. A paratransit \\nor  fixed  route  passenger’s  request  that  the \\ndriver  take  charge  of  a  service  animal  may \\nbe denied. Caring for a service animal is the \\nresponsibility of the passenger or a PCA. \\n\\n16. Opening Building Doors. For paratransit \\nservices, a passenger’s request for the driver \\nto  open  an  exterior  entry  door  to  a  building \\nto  provide  boarding  and/or  alighting  assist-\\nance  to  a  passenger  with  a  disability  should \\ngenerally  be  granted  as  long  as  providing \\nthis  assistance  would  not  pose  a  direct \\nthreat,  or  leave  the  vehicle  unattended  or \\nout of visual observation for a lengthy period \\nof  time.1 Note  that  a  request  for  ‘‘door- \\nthrough-door’’ service (i.e., assisting the pas-\\nsenger  past  the  door  to  the  building)  gen-\\nerally  would  not  need  to  be  granted  because \\nit could rise to the level of a fundamental al-\\nteration. \\n\\n17.  Exposing  Vehicle  to  Hazards.  If  the  pas-\\nsenger  requests  that  a  vehicle  follow  a  path \\n\\nat \\n\\n1 Please  see  guidance  issued  on  this  topic. \\nU.S.  Department  of  Transportation,  Origin- \\nto-Destination  Service,  September  1,  2005, \\nhttp://www.fta.dot.gov/ \\navailable \\n12325l3891.html  (explaining  that,  ‘‘the  De-\\npartment does not view transit providers’ ob-\\nligations  as  extending  to  the  provision  of \\npersonal services. . . . Nor would drivers, for \\nlengthy  periods  of  time,  have  to  leave  their \\nvehicles  unattended  or  lose  the  ability  to \\nkeep their vehicles under visual observation, \\nor take actions that would be clearly unsafe \\n. . .’’). \\n\\n527 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00537 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cPt. 37, App. E \\n\\n49 CFR Subtitle A (10–1–21 Edition) \\n\\nto a pick up or drop off point that would ex-\\npose  the  vehicle  and  its  occupants  to  haz-\\nards,  such  as  running  off  the  road,  getting \\nstuck,  striking  overhead  objects,  or  revers-\\ning  the  vehicle  down  a  narrow  alley,  the  re-\\nquest  can  be  denied  as  creating  a  direct \\nthreat. \\n\\n18.  Hard-to-Maneuver  Stops.  A  passenger \\nmay request that a paratransit vehicle navi-\\ngate  to  a  pick-up  point  to  which  it  is  dif-\\nficult  to  maneuver  a  vehicle.  A  passenger’s \\nrequest to be picked up in a location that is \\ndifficult,  but  not  impossible  or  impracti-\\ncable,  to  access  should  generally  be  granted \\nas long as picking up the passenger does not \\nexpose the vehicle to hazards that pose a di-\\nrect  threat  (e.g.,  it  is  unsafe  for  the  vehicle \\nand its occupants to get to the pick-up point \\nwithout  getting  stuck  or  running  off  the \\nroad). \\n\\n19.  Specific  Drivers.  A  passenger’s  request \\nfor a specific driver may be denied. Having a \\nspecific  driver  is  not  necessary  to afford the \\npassenger the service provided by the transit \\noperator. \\n\\n20. Luggage and Packages. A passenger’s re-\\nquest  for  a  fixed  route  or  paratransit  driver \\nto  assist  with  luggage  or  packages  may  be \\ndenied in those instances where it is not the \\nnormal  policy  or  practice  of  the  transpor-\\ntation agency to assist with luggage or pack-\\nages. Such assistance is a matter for the pas-\\nsenger or PCA, and providing this assistance \\nwould  be  a  fundamental  alteration  of  the \\ndriver’s function. \\n\\n21.  Request  to  Avoid  Specific  Passengers.  A \\nparatransit  passenger’s  request  not  to  ride \\nwith certain passengers may be denied. Para-\\ntransit  is  a  shared-ride  service.  As  a  result, \\none passenger may need to share the vehicle \\nwith people that he or she would rather not. \\n22.  Navigating  an  Incline,  or  Around  Obsta-\\ncles.  A  paratransit  passenger’s  request  for  a \\ndriver to help him or her navigate an incline \\n(e.g.,  a  driveway  or  sidewalk)  with  the  pas-\\nsenger’s  wheeled  device  should  generally  be \\ngranted. Likewise, assistance in traversing a \\ndifficult  sidewalk  (e.g.,  one  where  tree  roots \\nhave  made  the  sidewalk  impassible  for  a \\nwheelchair)  should  generally  be  granted,  as \\nshould  assistance  around  obstacles  (e.g., \\nsnowdrifts,  construction  areas)  between  the \\nvehicle  and  a  door  to  a  passenger’s  house  or \\ndestination  should  generally  be  granted. \\nThese  modifications  would  be  granted  sub-\\nject,  of  course,  to  the  proviso  that  such  as-\\nsistance  would  not  cause  a  direct  threat,  or \\nleave the vehicle unattended or out of visual \\nobservation for a lengthy period of time. \\n\\n23.  Extreme  Weather  Assistance.  A  pas-\\nsenger’s  request  to  be  assisted  from  his  or \\nher door to a vehicle during extreme weather \\nconditions  should  generally  be  granted  so \\nlong  as  the  driver  leaving  the  vehicle  to  as-\\nsist  would  not  pose  a  direct  threat,  or  leave \\nthe  vehicle  unattended  or  out  of  visual  ob-\\nservation  for  a  lengthy  period  of  time.  For \\n\\nexample,  in  extreme  weather  (e.g.,  very \\nwindy or stormy conditions), a person who is \\nblind  or  vision-impaired  or  a  frail  elderly \\nperson  may  have  difficulty  safely  moving  to \\nand from a building. \\n\\n24.  Unattended  Passengers.  Where  a  pas-\\nsenger’s  request  for  assistance  means  that \\nthe  driver  will  need  to  leave  passengers \\naboard  a  vehicle  unattended,  transportation \\nagencies  should  generally  grant  the  request \\nas long as accommodating the request would \\nnot  leave  the  vehicle  unattended  or  out  of \\nvisual  observation  for  a  lengthy  period  of \\ntime,  both  of  which  could  involve  direct \\nthreats  to  the  health  or  safety  of  the  unat-\\ntended passengers. It is important to keep in \\nmind that, just as a driver is not required to \\nact  as  a  PCA  for  a  passenger  making  a  re-\\nquest  for  assistance,  so  a  driver  is  not  in-\\ntended  to  act  as  a  PCA  for  other  passengers \\nin  the  vehicle,  such  that  he  or  she  must  re-\\nmain in their physical presence at all times. \\n25.  Need  for  Return  Trip  Assistance.  A  pas-\\nsenger with a disability may need assistance \\nfor a return trip when he or she did not need \\nthat assistance on the initial trip. For exam-\\nple,  a  dialysis  patient  may  have  no  problem \\nwaiting at the curb for a ride to go to the di-\\nalysis  center,  but  may  well  require  assist-\\nance to the door on his or her return trip be-\\ncause of physical weakness or fatigue. To the \\nextent that this need is predictable, it should \\nbe  handled  in  advance,  either  as  part  of  the \\neligibility  process  or  the  provider’s  reserva-\\ntions  process.  If  the  need  arises  unexpect-\\nedly, then it would need to be handled on an \\nad  hoc  basis.  The  paratransit  operator \\nshould generally provide such assistance, un-\\nless doing so would create a direct threat, or \\nleave the vehicle unattended or out of visual \\nobservation for a lengthy period of time. \\n\\n26.  Five-Minute  Warning  or  Notification  of \\nArrival Calls. A passenger’s request for a tele-\\nphone  call  5  minutes  (or  another  reasonable \\ninterval) in advance or at time of vehicle ar-\\nrival generally should be granted. As a mat-\\nter of courtesy, such calls are encouraged as \\na  good  customer  service  model  and  can  pre-\\nvent ‘‘no shows.’’ Oftentimes, these calls can \\nbe  generated  through  an  automated  system. \\nIn  those  situations  where  automated  sys-\\ntems  are  not  available  and  paratransit  driv-\\ners  continue  to  rely  on  hand-held  commu-\\nnication  devices  (e.g.,  cellular  telephones) \\ndrivers  should  comply  with  any  State  or \\nFederal laws related to distracted driving. \\n\\n27.  Hand-Carrying.  Except  in  emergency \\nsituations, a passenger’s request for a driver \\nto lift the passenger out of his or her mobil-\\nity device should generally be denied because \\nof the safety, dignity, and privacy issues im-\\nplicated by hand-carrying a passenger.

This  provision  does  not  re-\\nquire  that  inaccessible  buses  be  retro-\\n\\nfitted with lifts, ramps or other board-\\ning devices. \\n\\n§ 38.23 Mobility aid accessibility. \\n\\n(a)  General.  All  vehicles  covered  by \\nthis  subpart  shall  provide  a  level- \\nchange  mechanism  or  boarding  device \\n(e.g.,  lift  or  ramp)  complying  with \\nparagraph (b) or (c) of this section and \\nsufficient clearances to permit a wheel-\\nchair  or  other  mobility  aid  user  to \\nreach  a  securement  location.  At  least \\ntwo  securement  locations  and  devices, \\ncomplying  with  paragraph  (d)  of  this \\nsection,  shall  be  provided  on  vehicles \\nin  excess  of  22  feet  in  length;  at  least \\none  securement  location  and  device, \\ncomplying  with  paragraph  (d)  of  this \\nsection, shall be provided on vehicles 22 \\nfeet in length or less. \\n\\n(b)  Vehicle  lift—(1)  Design  load.  The \\ndesign  load  of  the  lift  shall  be  at  least \\n600  pounds.  Working  parts,  such  as  ca-\\nbles,  pulleys,  and  shafts,  which  can  be \\nexpected  to  wear,  and  upon  which  the \\nlift  depends  for  support  of  the  load, \\nshall  have  a  safety  factor  of  at  least \\nsix,  based  on  the  ultimate  strength  of \\nthe  material.  Nonworking  parts,  such \\nas  platform,  frame,  and  attachment \\nhardware  which  would  not  be  expected \\nto wear, shall have a safety factor of at \\nleast  three,  based  on  the  ultimate \\nstrength of the material. \\n\\n(2)  Controls—(i)  Requirements.  The \\ncontrols  shall  be  interlocked  with  the \\nvehicle  brakes,  transmission,  or  door, \\nor  shall  provide  other  appropriate \\nmechanisms or systems, to ensure that \\nthe  vehicle  cannot  be  moved  when  the \\nlift is not stowed and so the lift cannot \\nbe  deployed  unless  the  interlocks  or \\nsystems  are  engaged.

Nonworking  parts,  such \\nas  platform,  frame,  and  attachment \\nhardware  which  would  not  be  expected \\nto wear, shall have a safety factor of at \\nleast  three,  based  on  the  ultimate \\nstrength of the material. \\n\\n(2)  Controls—(i)  Requirements.  The \\ncontrols  shall  be  interlocked  with  the \\nvehicle  brakes,  propulsion  system,  or \\ndoor, or shall provide other appropriate \\nmechanisms or systems, to ensure that \\nthe  vehicle  cannot  be  moved  when  the \\nlift is not stowed and so the lift cannot \\nbe  deployed  unless  the  interlocks  or \\nsystems  are  engaged.  The  lift  shall  de-\\nploy  to  all  levels  (i.e.,  ground,  curb, \\nand  intermediate  positions)  normally \\nencountered  in  the  operating  environ-\\nment. Where provided, each control for \\ndeploying,  lowering,  raising,  and  stow-\\ning  the  lift  and  lowering  the  roll-off \\nbarrier  shall  be  of  a  momentary  con-\\ntact type requiring continuous manual \\npressure  by  the  operator  and  shall  not \\nallow  improper  lift  sequencing  when \\nthe  lift  platform  is  occupied.  The  con-\\ntrols shall allow reversal of the lift op-\\neration  sequence,  such  as  raising  or \\nlowering  a  platform  that  is  part  way \\ndown,  without  allowing  an  occupied \\nplatform  to  fold  or  retract  into  the \\nstowed position. \\n\\n(ii) Exception. Where physical or safe-\\nty  constraints  prevent  the  deployment \\nat  some  stops  of  a  lift  having  its  long \\ndimension perpendicular to the vehicle \\naxis,  the  transportation  entity  may \\nspecify  a  lift  which  is  designed  to  de-\\nploy with its long dimension parallel to \\nthe  vehicle  axis  and  which  pivots  into \\nor  out  of  the  vehicle  while  occupied \\n(i.e.,  ‘‘rotary  lift’’).  The  requirements \\nof  paragraph  (b)(2)(i)  of  this  section \\nprohibiting  the  lift  from  being  stowed \\nwhile occupied shall not apply to a lift \\ndesign  of  this  type  if  the  stowed  posi-\\ntion  is  within  the  passenger  compart-\\nment  and  the  lift  is  intended  to  be \\nstowed while occupied. \\n\\n(iii)  Exception.  The  brake  or  propul-\\nsion  system  interlocks  requirement \\ndoes  not  apply  to  a  station  platform \\nmounted  lift  provided  that  a  mechan-\\nical,  electrical  or  other  system  oper-\\n\\nates  to  ensure  that  vehicles  do  not \\nmove when the lift is in use. \\n\\n(3) Emergency operation. The lift shall \\nincorporate  an  emergency  method  of \\ndeploying,  lowering  to  ground  level \\nwith  a  lift  occupant,  and  raising  and \\nstowing  the  empty  lift  if  the  power  to \\nthe  lift  fails.  No  emergency  method, \\nmanual  or  otherwise,  shall  be  capable \\nof  being  operated  in  a  manner  that \\ncould be hazardous to the lift occupant \\nor  to  the  operator  when  operated  ac-\\ncording to manufacturer’s instructions, \\nand shall not permit the platform to be \\nstowed or folded when occupied, unless \\nthe  lift  is  a  rotary  lift  intended  to  be \\nstowed while occupied. \\n\\n(4)  Power  or  equipment  failure.  Lift \\nplatforms stowed in a vertical position, \\nand deployed platforms when occupied, \\nshall  have  provisions  to  prevent  their \\ndeploying, falling, or folding any faster \\nthan 12 inches/second or their dropping \\nof an occupant in the event of a single \\nfailure  of  any  load  carrying  compo-\\nnent. \\n\\n(5) Platform barriers. The lift platform \\nshall  be  equipped  with  barriers  to  pre-\\nvent  any  of  the  wheels  of  a  wheelchair \\nor mobility aid from rolling off the lift \\nduring its operation. A movable barrier \\nor  inherent  design  feature  shall  pre-\\nvent a wheelchair or mobility aid from \\nrolling off the edge closest to the vehi-\\ncle  until  the  lift  is  in  its  fully  raised \\nposition. Each side  of the lift platform \\nwhich extends beyond the vehicle in its \\nraised  position  shall  have  a  barrier  a \\nminimum  11⁄2 inches  high.  Such  bar-\\nriers  shall  not  interfere  with  maneu-\\nvering  into  or  out  of  the  aisle.  The \\nloading-edge  barrier  (outer  barrier) \\nwhich  functions  as  a  loading  ramp \\nwhen  the  lift  is  at  ground  level,  shall \\nbe sufficient when raised or closed, or a \\nsupplementary  system  shall  be  pro-\\nvided, to prevent a power wheelchair or \\nmobility aid from riding over or defeat-\\ning  it.  The  outer  barrier  on  the  out-\\nboard  of  the  lift  shall  automatically \\nrise  or  close,  or  a  supplementary  sys-\\ntem  shall  automatically  engage,  and \\nremain raised, closed, or engaged at all \\ntimes  that  the  lift  is  more  than  3 \\ninches  above  the  station  platform  or \\nroadway and the lift is occupied.

The lift platform \\nsurface shall be free of any protrusions \\nover  1⁄4 inch  high  and  shall  be  slip  re-\\nsistant.  The  lift  platform  shall  have  a \\nminimum  clear  width  of  281⁄2 inches  at \\nthe  platform,  a  minimum  clear  width \\nof  30  inches  measured  from  2  inches \\nabove  the  lift  platform  surface  to  30 \\ninches  above  the  surface,  and  a  min-\\nimum  clear  length  of  48  inches  meas-\\nured from 2 inches above the surface of \\nthe platform to 30 inches above the sur-\\nface. (See Fig. 1) \\n\\n(7)  Platform  gaps.  Any  openings  be-\\ntween the lift platform surface and the \\nraised barriers shall not exceed  5⁄8 inch \\nwide.  When  the  lift  is  at  vehicle  floor \\nheight  with  the  inner  barrier  (if  appli-\\ncable) down or retracted, gaps between \\nthe  forward  lift  platform  edge  and  ve-\\nhicle  floor  shall  not  exceed  1⁄2\\ninch \\ninch  vertically. \\nhorizontally  and  5⁄8\\nPlatforms on semi-automatic lifts may \\nhave  a  hand  hold  not  exceeding  11⁄2 \\ninches  by  41⁄2 inches  located  between \\nthe edge barriers. \\n\\n(8)  Platform  entrance  ramp.  The  en-\\ntrance  ramp,  or  loading-edge  barrier \\nused as a ramp, shall not exceed a slope \\nof  1:8  measured  on  level  ground,  for  a \\nmaximum  rise  of  3  inches,  and  the \\ntransition from the station platform or \\nroadway to ramp may be vertical with-\\nout  edge  treatment  up  to  1⁄4\\ninch. \\nThresholds between  1⁄4 inch and  1⁄2 inch \\nhigh  shall  be  beveled  with  a  slope  no \\ngreater than 1:2. \\n\\n(9)  Platform  deflection.  The  lift  plat-\\nform (not including the entrance ramp) \\nshall  not  deflect  more  than  3  degrees \\n(exclusive  of  vehicle  roll)  in  any  direc-\\ntion  between  its  unloaded  position  and \\nits  position  when  loaded  with  600 \\npounds  applied  through  a  26  inch  by  26 \\ninch  test  pallet  at  the  centroid  of  the \\nlift platform. \\n\\n(10) Platform movement. No part of the \\nplatform  shall  move  at  a  rate  exceed-\\ning 6 inches/second during lowering and \\nlifting  an  occupant,  and  shall  not  ex-\\nceed  12  inches/second  during  deploying \\nor  stowing.  This  requirement  does  not \\n\\napply to the deployment or stowage cy-\\ncles of lifts that are manually deployed \\nor stowed. The maximum platform hor-\\nizontal  and  vertical  acceleration  when \\noccupied shall be 0.3g. \\n\\n(11)  Boarding  direction.  The  lift  shall \\npermit  both  inboard  and  outboard  fac-\\ning of wheelchairs and mobility aids. \\n\\n(12)  Use  by  standees.  Lifts  shall  ac-\\ncommodate  persons  using  walkers, \\ncrutches, canes or braces or who other-\\nwise  have  difficulty  using  steps.  The \\nlift  may  be  marked  to  indicate  a  pre-\\nferred standing position. \\n\\n(13)  Handrails.  Platforms  on  lifts \\nshall  be  equipped  with  handrails,  on \\ntwo  sides,  which  move  in  tandem  with \\nthe  lift  which  shall  be  graspable  and \\nprovide support to standees throughout \\nthe  entire  lift  operation.  Handrails \\nshall have a usable component at least \\n8 inches long with the lowest portion a \\nminimum 30 inches above the platform \\nand  the  highest  portion  a  maximum  38 \\ninches  above  the  platform.  The  hand-\\nrails shall be capable of withstanding a \\nforce of 100 pounds concentrated at any \\npoint  on  the  handrail  without  perma-\\nnent deformation of the rail or its sup-\\nporting structure. Handrails shall have \\na  cross-sectional  diameter  between  11⁄4 \\ninches  and  11⁄2 inches  or  shall  provide \\nan  equivalent  grasping  surface,  and \\nhave  eased  edges  with  corner  radii  of \\nnot less than 1⁄8 inch. Handrails shall be \\nplaced to provide a minimum 11⁄2 inches \\nknuckle clearance from the nearest ad-\\njacent  surface.  Handrails  shall  not \\ninterfere  with  wheelchair  or  mobility \\naid  maneuverability  when  entering  or \\nleaving the vehicle. \\n\\n(c) Vehicle ramp or bridge plate—(1) De-\\nsign  load.  Ramps  or  bridge  plates  30 \\ninches or longer shall support a load of \\n600  pounds,  placed  at  the  centroid  of \\nthe  ramp  or  bridge  plate  distributed \\nover an area of 26 inches, with a safety \\nfactor  of  at  least  3  based  on  the  ulti-\\nmate  strength  of  the  material.  Ramps \\nor  bridge  plates  shorter  than  30  inches \\nshall support a load of 300 pounds. \\n\\n(2)  Ramp  surface.  The  ramp  or  bridge \\nplate  surface  shall  be  continuous  and \\nslip  resistant,  shall  not  have  protru-\\nsions  from  the  surface  greater  then  1⁄4 \\ninch,  shall  have  a  clear  width  of  30 \\ninches,  and  shall  accommodate  both \\nfour-wheel  and  three-wheel  mobility \\naids. \\n\\n541 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00551 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0c§ 38.85 \\n\\n49 CFR Subtitle A (10–1–21 Edition) \\n\\n(3)  Ramp  threshold.

All new commuter rail \\ncars,  other  than  level  entry  cars,  cov-\\nered  by  this  subpart  shall  provide  a \\nlevel-change  mechanism  or  boarding \\ndevice  (e.g.,  lift,  ramp  or  bridge  plate) \\ncomplying with either paragraph (b) or \\n(c) of this section; sufficient clearances \\nto permit a wheelchair or mobility aid \\nuser to reach a seating location; and at \\nleast  two  wheelchair  or  mobility  aid \\nseating locations complying with para-\\ngraph (d) of this section. \\n\\n(2)  Exception.  If  level-entry  boarding, \\nportable  or  platform  lifts,  ramps  or \\nbridge  plates  meeting  the  applicable \\nrequirements  of  this  section  are  pro-\\nvided  on  station  platforms  or  other \\nstops  required  to  be  accessible,  or \\nmini-high  platforms  complying  with \\n§ 38.93(d) are provided, the car is not re-\\nquired  to  be  equipped  with  a  car-borne \\ndevice.  The  access  systems  or  devices \\nused at a station to which section 37.42 \\napplies  must  permit  compliance  with \\nthat section. \\n\\n(b)  Car  Lift—(1)  Design  load.  The  de-\\nsign load of the lift shall be at least 600 \\npounds.  Working  parts,  such  as  cables, \\npulleys,  and  shafts,  which  can  be  ex-\\npected to wear, and upon which the lift \\ndepends  for  support  of  the  load,  shall \\nhave  a  safety  factor  of  at  least  six, \\nbased  on  the  ultimate  strength  of  the \\nmaterial.  Nonworking  parts,  such  as \\nplatform, frame, and attachment hard-\\nware  which  would  not  be  expected  to \\nwear,  shall  have  a  safety  factor  of  at \\nleast  three,  based  on  the  ultimate \\nstrength of the material. \\n\\n(2)  Controls—(i)  Requirements.  The \\ncontrols  shall  be  interlocked  with  the \\ncar brakes, propulsion system, or door, \\nor  shall  provide  other  appropriate \\nmechanisms or systems, to ensure that \\nthe  car  cannot  be  moved  when  the  lift \\nis not stowed and so the lift cannot be \\ndeployed  unless  the  interlocks  or  sys-\\ntems are engaged. The lift shall deploy \\nto all platform levels normally encoun-\\n\\ntered  in  the  operating  environment. \\nWhere  provided,  each  control  for  de-\\nploying,  lowering,  raising,  and  stowing \\nthe  lift  and  lowering  the  roll-off  bar-\\nrier  shall  be  of  a  monetary  contact \\ntype requiring continuous manual pres-\\nsure  by  the  operator  and  shall  not \\nallow  improper  lift  sequencing  when \\nthe  lift  platform  is  occupied.  The  con-\\ntrols shall allow reversal of the lift op-\\neration  sequence,  such  as  raising  or \\nlowering  a  platform  that  is  part  way \\ndown,  without  allowing  an  occupied \\nplatform  to  fold  or  retract  into  the \\nstowed position. \\n\\n(ii) Exception. Where physical or safe-\\nty  constraints  prevent  the  deployment \\nat  some  stops  of  a  lift  having  its  long \\ndimension  perpendicular  to  the  car \\naxis,  the  transportation  entity  may \\nspecify  a  lift  which  is  designed  to  de-\\nploy with its long dimension parallel to \\nthe  car  axis  and  which  pivots  into  or \\nout of the car while occupied (i.e., ‘‘ro-\\ntary  lift’’).  The  requirements  of  para-\\ngraph  (b)(2)(i)  of  this  section  prohib-\\niting  the  lift  from  being  stowed  while \\noccupied shall not apply to a lift design \\nof  this  type  if  the  stowed  position  is \\nwithin the passenger compartment and \\nthe  lift  is  intended  to  be  stowed  while \\noccupied. \\n\\n(iii)  Exception.  The  brake  or  propul-\\nsion system interlock requirement does \\nnot  apply  to  a  platform  mounted  or \\nportable  lift  provided  that  a  mechan-\\nical,  electrical  or  other  system  oper-\\nates  to  ensure  that  cars  do  not  move \\nwhen the lift is in use. \\n\\n(3) Emergency operation. The lift shall \\nincorporate  an  emergency  method  of \\ndeploying,  lowering  to  ground  or  plat-\\nform  level  with  a  lift  occupant,  and \\nraising  and  stowing  the  empty  lift  if \\nthe  power  to  the  lift  fails.  No  emer-\\ngency  method,  manual  or  otherwise, \\nshall  be  capable  of  being  operated  in  a \\nmanner that could be hazardous to the \\nlift  occupant  or  to  the  operator  when \\noperated  according  to  manufacturer’s \\ninstructions,  and  shall  not  permit  the \\nplatform  to  be  stowed  or  folded  when \\noccupied, unless the lift is a rotary lift \\nintended to be stowed while occupied. \\n\\n(4)  Power  or  equipment  failure.  Plat-\\nforms stowed in a vertical position, and \\ndeployed  platforms  when  occupied, \\nshall  have  provisions  to  prevent  their \\ndeploying, falling, or folding any faster \\n\\n544 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00554 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cOffice of the Secretary of Transportation \\n\\n§ 38.95 \\n\\nthan 12 inches/second or their dropping \\nof an occupant in the event of a single \\nfailure  of  any  load  carrying  compo-\\nnent. \\n\\n(5) Platform barriers. The lift platform \\nshall  be  equipped  with  barriers  to  pre-\\nvent  any  of  the  wheels  of  a  wheelchair \\nor mobility aid from rolling off the lift \\nduring its operation. A movable barrier \\nor  inherent  design  feature  shall  pre-\\nvent a wheelchair or mobility aid from \\nrolling  off  the  edge  closest  to  the  car \\nuntil the lift is in its fully raised posi-\\ntion.  Each  side  of  the  lift  platform \\nwhich,  in  its  raised  position,  extends \\nbeyond  the  car  shall  have  a  barrier  a \\nminimum  11⁄2 inches  high.  Such  bar-\\nriers  shall  not  interfere  with  maneu-\\nvering into or out of the car. The load-\\ning-edge  barrier  (outer  barrier)  which \\nfunctions  as  a  loading  ramp  when  the \\nlift  is  at  ground  or  station  platform \\nlevel, shall be sufficient when raised or \\nclosed,  or  a  supplementary  system \\nshall  be  provided,  to  prevent  a  power \\nwheelchair  or  mobility  aid  from  riding \\nover  or  defeating  it.  The  outer  barrier \\nof  the  lift  shall  automatically  rise  or \\nclose, or a supplementary system shall \\nautomatically  engage,  and  remain \\nraised,  closed,  or  engaged  at  all  times \\nthat  the  lift  platform  is  more  than  3 \\ninches  above  the  station  platform  and \\nthe  lift  is  occupied.  Alternatively,  a \\nbarrier  or  system  may  be  raised,  low-\\nered,  opened,  closed,  engaged  or  dis-\\nengaged  by  the  lift  operator  provided \\nan interlock or inherent design feature \\nprevents the lift from rising unless the \\nbarrier  is  raised  or  closed  or  the  sup-\\nplementary system is engaged. \\n\\n(6) Platform surface. The lift platform \\nsurface shall be free of any protrusions \\nover  1⁄4 inch  high  and  shall  be  slip  re-\\nsistant.  The  lift  platform  shall  have  a \\nminimum  clear  width  of  281⁄2 inches  at \\nthe  platform,  a  minimum  clear  width \\nof  30  inches  measured  from  2  inches \\nabove  the  lift  platform  surface  to  30 \\ninches  above  the  surface,  and  a  min-\\nimum  clear  length  of  48  inches  meas-\\nured from 2 inches above the surface of \\nthe platform to 30 inches above the sur-\\nface. (See Fig. 1) \\n\\n(7)  Platform  gaps.  Any  openings  be-\\ntween the lift platform surface and the \\nraised barriers shall not exceed  5⁄8 inch \\nwide.  When  the  lift  is  at  car  floor \\nheight  with  the  inner  barrier  down  (if \\n\\napplicable)  or  retracted,  gaps  between \\nthe  forward  lift  platform  edge  and  car \\nfloor  shall  not  exceed  1⁄2\\ninch  hori-\\nzontally and 5⁄8 inch vertically. \\n\\n(8)  Platform  entrance  ramp.  The  en-\\ntrance  ramp,  or  loading-edge  barrier \\nused as a ramp, shall not exceed a slope \\nof  1:8,  when  measured  on  level  ground, \\nfor a maximum rise of 3 inches, and the \\ntransition  from  station  platform  to \\nramp  may  be  vertical  without  edge \\ntreatment up to 1⁄4 inch. Thresholds be-\\ntween  1⁄4 inch and  1⁄2 inch high shall be \\nbeveled  with  a  slope  no  greater  than \\n1:2. \\n\\n(9)  Platform  deflection.  The  lift  plat-\\nform (not including the entrance ramp) \\nshall  not  deflect  more  than  3  degrees \\n(exclusive  of  vehicle  roll)  in  any  direc-\\ntion  between  its  unloaded  position  and \\nits  position  when  loaded  with  600 \\npounds  applied  through  a  26  inch  by  26 \\ninch  test  pallet  at  the  centroid  of  the \\nlift platform. \\n\\n(10) Platform movement. No part of the \\nplatform  shall  move  at  a  rate  exceed-\\ning 6 inches/second during lowering and \\nlifting  an  occupant,  and  shall  not  ex-\\nceed  12  inches/second  during  deploying \\nor  stowing.  This  requirement  does  not \\napply to the deployment or stowage cy-\\ncles of lifts that are manually deployed \\nor stowed. The maximum platform hor-\\nizontal  and  vertical  acceleration  when \\noccupied shall be 0.3g. \\n\\n(11)  Boarding  direction.  The  lift  shall \\npermit  both  inboard  and  outboard  fac-\\ning of wheelchairs and mobility aids. \\n\\n(12)  Use  by  standees.  Lifts  shall  ac-\\ncommodate  persons  using  walkers, \\ncrutches, canes or braces or who other-\\nwise  have  difficulty  using  steps.  The \\nlift  may  be  marked  to  indicate  a  pre-\\nferred standing position. \\n\\n(13)  Handrails.  Platforms  on  lifts \\nshall  be  equipped  with  handrails,  on \\ntwo  sides,  which  move  in  tandem  with \\nthe  lift  which  shall  be  graspable  and \\nprovide support to standees throughout \\nthe  entire  lift  operation.  Handrails \\nshall have a usable component at least \\n8 inches long with the lowest portion a \\nminimum 30 inches above the platform \\nand  the  highest  portion  a  maximum  38 \\ninches  above  the  platform.

Where provided, each control for \\ndeploying,  lowering,  raising,  and  stow-\\ning  the  lift  and  lowering  the  roll-off \\nbarrier  shall  be  of  a  momentary  con-\\ntact type requiring continuous manual \\npressure  by  the  operator  and  shall  not \\nallow  improper  lift  sequencing  when \\nthe  lift  platform  is  occupied.  The  con-\\ntrols shall allow reversal of the lift op-\\neration  sequence,  such  as  raising  or \\nlowering  a  platform  that  is  part  way \\ndown,  without  allowing  an  occupied \\nplatform  to  fold  or  retract  into  the \\nstowed position. \\n\\n(ii)  Exception.  Where  the  lift  is  de-\\nsigned  to  deploy  with  its  long  dimen-\\nsion  parallel  to  the  vehicle  axis  and \\nwhich  pivots  into  or  out  of  the  vehicle \\nwhile  occupied  (i.e.,  ‘‘rotary  lift’’),  the \\nrequirements  of  this  paragraph  (b)(2) \\nprohibiting  the  lift  from  being  stowed \\nwhile  occupied  shall  not  apply  if  the \\nstowed position is within the passenger \\ncompartment  and  the  lift  is  intended \\nto be stowed while occupied. \\n\\n(3) Emergency operation. The lift shall \\nincorporate  an  emergency  method  of \\ndeploying,  lowering  to  ground  level \\nwith  a  lift  occupant,  and  raising  and \\nstowing  the  empty  lift  if  the  power  to \\nthe  lift  fails.  No  emergency  method, \\nmanual  or  otherwise,  shall  be  capable \\nof  being  operated  in  a  manner  that \\ncould be hazardous to the lift occupant \\nor  to  the  operator  when  operated  ac-\\ncording to manufacturer’s instructions, \\nand shall not permit the platform to be \\nstowed or folded when occupied, unless \\nthe  lift  is  a  rotary  lift  and  is  intended \\nto be stowed while occupied. \\n\\n(4)  Power  or  equipment  failure.  Plat-\\nforms stowed in a vertical position, and \\ndeployed  platforms  when  occupied, \\nshall  have  provisions  to  prevent  their \\n\\ndeploying, falling, or folding any faster \\nthan  12  inches/second  (305  mm/sec)  or \\ntheir  dropping  of  an  occupant  in  the \\nevent  of  a  single  failure  of  any  load \\ncarrying component. \\n\\n(5) Platform barriers. The lift platform \\nshall  be  equipped  with  barriers  to  pre-\\nvent  any  of  the  wheels  of  a  wheelchair \\nor  mobility  aid  from  rolling  off  the \\nplatform  during  its  operation.  A  mov-\\nable  barrier  or  inherent  design  feature \\nshall  prevent  a  wheelchair  or  mobility \\naid from rolling off the edge closest to \\nthe  vehicle  until  the  platform  is  in  its \\nfully  raised  position.  Each  side  of  the \\nlift platform which extends beyond the \\nvehicle in its raised position shall have \\na barrier a minimum 11⁄2 inches (13 mm) \\nhigh.  Such  barriers  shall  not  interfere \\nwith  maneuvering  into  or  out  of  the \\naisle.  The  loading-edge  barrier  (outer \\nbarrier)  which  functions  as  a  loading \\nramp  when  the  lift  is  at  ground  level, \\nshall  be  sufficient  when  raised  or \\nclosed,  or  a  supplementary  system \\nshall  be  provided,  to  prevent  a  power \\nwheelchair  or  mobility  aid  from  riding \\nover  or  defeating  it.  The  outer  barrier \\nof  the  lift  shall  automatically  raise  or \\nclose, or a supplementary system shall \\nautomatically  engage,  and  remain \\nraised,  closed,  or  engaged  at  all  times \\nthat the platform is more than 3 inches \\n(75 mm) above the roadway or sidewalk \\nand  the  platform  is  occupied.  Alter-\\nnatively,  a  barrier  or  system  may  be \\nraised,  lowered,  opened,  closed,  en-\\ngaged,  or  disengaged  by  the  lift  oper-\\nator, provided an interlock or inherent \\ndesign  feature  prevents  the  lift  from \\nrising  unless  the  barrier  is  raised  or \\nclosed  or  the  supplementary  system  is \\nengaged. \\n\\n(6) Platform surface. The platform sur-\\nface  shall  be  free  of  any  protrusions  of \\n1⁄4 inch  (6.5  mm)  high  and  shall  be  slip \\nresistant.  The  platform  shall  have  a \\nminimum clear width of 281⁄2 inches (725 \\nmm) at the platform, a minimum clear \\nwidth  of  30  inches  (760  mm)  measured \\nfrom  2  inches  (50  mm)  above  the  plat-\\nform  surface  to  30  inches  (760  mm) \\nabove  the  platform,  and  a  minimum \\nclear  length  of  48  inches  (1220  mm) \\nmeasured  from  2  inches  (50  mm)  above \\nthe surface of the platform to 30 inches \\n(760 mm) above the surface of the plat-\\nform.

Each  entry  is  applicable  to  all \\nsubparts  of  this  part  except  where  noted. \\nNothing  in  this  appendix  shall  in  any  way \\nobviate  any  obligation  to  comply  with  the \\nrequirements of the standards themselves. \\n\\nI.  Slip  Resistant  Surface—Aisles,  Steps,  Floor \\nAreas Where People Walk, Floor Areas in Se-\\ncurement Locations, Lift Platforms, Ramps \\n\\nSlip  resistance  is  based  on  the  frictional \\nforce necessary to keep a shoe heel or crutch \\ntip from slipping on a walking surface under \\nconditions likely to be found on the surface. \\nWhile  the  dynamic  coefficient  of  friction \\nduring walking varies in a complex and non- \\nuniform  way,  the  static  coefficient  of  fric-\\ntion, which can be measured in several ways, \\nprovides a close approximation of the slip re-\\nsistance of a surface. Contrary to popular be-\\nlief,  some  slippage  is  necessary  to  walking, \\n\\n564 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00574 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\n/\\n\\n>\\nH\\nP\\nG\\n<\\n6\\n9\\n1\\n.\\n1\\n9\\nE\\nF\\n2\\n0\\nC\\nE\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cOffice of the Secretary of Transportation \\n\\nPt. 38, App. \\n\\nespecially for persons with restricted gaits; a \\ntruly  ‘‘non-slip’’  surface  could  not  be  nego-\\ntiated. \\n\\nThe  Occupational  Safety  and  Health  Ad-\\nministration  recommends  that  walking  sur-\\nfaces  have  a  static  coefficient  of  friction  of \\n0.5.  A  research  project  sponsored  by  the  Ar-\\nchitectural  and  Transportation  Barriers \\nCompliance  Board  (Access  Board)  conducted \\ntests  with  persons  with  disabilities  and  con-\\ncluded  that  a  higher  coefficient  of  friction \\nwas  needed  by  such  persons.  A  static  coeffi-\\ncient  of  friction  of  0.6  is  recommended  for \\nsteps,  floors,  and  lift  platforms  and  0.8  for \\nramps. \\n\\nIt is recognized that the coefficient of fric-\\ntion  varies  considerably  due  to  the  presence \\nof  contaminants,  water,  floor  finishes,  and \\nother factors not under the control of transit \\nproviders  and  may  be  difficult  to  measure. \\nNevertheless,  many  common  materials  suit-\\nable  for  flooring  are  now  labeled  with  infor-\\nmation  on  the  static  coefficient  of  friction. \\nWhile it may not be possible to compare one \\nproduct  directly  with  another,  or  to  guar-\\nantee  a  constant  measure,  transit  operators \\nor  vehicle  designers  and  manufacturers  are \\nencouraged  to  specify  materials  with  appro-\\npriate  values.  As  more  products  include  in-\\nformation  on  slip  resistance,  improved  uni-\\nformity in measurement and specification is \\nlikely.  The  Access  Board’s  advisory  guide-\\nlines on Slip Resistant Surfaces provides ad-\\nditional information on this subject. \\n\\nII. Color Contrast—Step Edges, Lift Platform \\nEdges \\n\\nThe  material  used  to  provide  contrast \\nshould  contrast  by  at  least  70%.  Contrast  in \\npercent is determined by: \\nContrast=[B¥B)/B] × 100 \\nWhere  B  =  light  reflectance  value  (LRV)  of \\n\\nthe lighter area \\n\\nand B = light reflectance value (LRV) of the \\n\\ndarker area. \\n\\nNote that in any application both white and \\nblack  are  never  absolute;  thus,  B  never \\nequals 100 and B is always greater than 0. \\n\\nIII. Handrails and Stanchions \\n\\nIn  addition  to  the  requirements  for  hand-\\nrails  and  stanchions  for  rapid,  light,  and \\ncommuter rail vehicles, consideration should \\nbe  given  to  the  proximity  of  handrails  or \\nstanchions  to  the  area  in  which  wheelchair \\nor  mobility  aid  users  may  position  them-\\nselves. When identifying the clear floor space \\nwhere  a  wheelchair  or  mobility  aid  user  can \\nbe  accommodated,  it  is  suggested  that  at \\nleast  one  such  area  be  adjacent  or  in  close \\nproximity  to  a  handrail  or  stanchion.  Of \\ncourse,  such  a  handrail  or  stanchion  cannot \\nencroach upon the required 32 inch width re-\\nquired  for  the  doorway  or  the  route  leading \\nto  the  clear  floor  space  which  must  be  at \\nleast 30 by 48 inches in size. \\n\\nIV. Priority Seating Signs and Other Signage \\n\\nA.  Finish  and  Contrast.  The  characters  and \\nbackground  of  signs  should  be  eggshell, \\nmatte, or other non-glare finish. An eggshell \\nfinish  (11  to  19  degree  gloss  on  60  degree \\nglossimeter)  is  recommended.  Characters \\nand  symbols  shall  contrast  with  their  back-\\nground—either  light  characters  on  a  dark \\nbackground  or  dark  characters  on  a  light \\nbackground.  Research  indicates  that  signs \\nare  more  legible  for  persons  with  low  vision \\nwhen  characters  contrast  with  their  back-\\nground  by  at  least  70  percent.  Contrast  in \\npercent shall be determined by: \\nContrast=[B¥B)/B] × 100 \\nWhere  B  =  light  reflectance  value  (LRV)  of \\n\\nthe lighter area \\n\\nand B = light reflectance value (LRV) of the \\n\\ndarker area. \\n\\nNote that in any application both white and \\nblack  are  never  absolute;  thus,  B  never \\nequals 100 and B is always greater than 0. \\n\\nreadability \\n\\nThe  greatest \\n\\nis  usually \\nachieved  through  the  use  of  light-colored \\ncharacters or symbols on a dark background. \\nB.  Destination  and  Route  Signs.  (The  fol-\\nlowing specifications, which are required for \\nbuses  (§ 38.39),  are  recommended  for  other \\ntypes of vehicles, particularly light rail vehi-\\ncles, were appropriate.) \\n\\n1.  Where  destination  or  route  information \\nis displayed on the exterior of a vehicle, each \\nvehicle  shall  have  illuminated  signs  on  the \\nfront and boarding side of the vehicle. \\n\\n2.  Characters  on  signs  required  by  para-\\ngraph  IV.B.1  of  this  appendix  shall  have  a \\nwidth-to-height ratio between 3:5 and 1:1 and \\na  stroke  width-to-height  ratio  between  1:5 \\nand  1:10,  with  a  minimum  character  height \\n(using an upper case ‘‘X’’) of 1 inch for signs \\non  the  boarding  side  and  a  minimum  char-\\nacter  height  of \\nfront \\n2 \\n‘‘headsigns,’’ with ‘‘wide’’ spacing (generally, \\nthe  space  between  letters  shall  be  1⁄16 the \\nheight  of  upper  case  letters),  and  shall  con-\\ntrast  with  the  background,  either  dark-on- \\nlight  or  light-on-dark,  or  as  recommended \\nabove. \\n\\ninches \\n\\nfor \\n\\nC.  Designation  of  Accessible  Vehicles.  The \\nInternational Symbol of Accessibility should \\nbe displayed as shown in Figure 6. \\n\\nV. Public Information Systems \\n\\nEntities  are  encouraged  to  employ  any \\navailable  services,  signage,  or  alternative \\nsystems  or  devices  that  are  capable  of  pro-\\nviding the same or equivalent information to \\npersons with hearing loss. Two possible types \\nof devices are visual display systems and lis-\\ntening  systems.  However,  it  should  be  noted \\nthat  while  visual  display  systems  accommo-\\ndate persons who are deaf or are hearing im-\\npaired,  assistive  listening  systems  aid  only \\nthose with a partial loss of hearing. \\n\\n565 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00575 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cPt. 38, App. \\n\\n49 CFR Subtitle A (10–1–21 Edition) \\n\\nA.  Visual  Display  Systems.  Announcements \\nmay  be  provided  in  a  visual  format  by  the \\nuse  of  electronic  message  boards  or  video \\nmonitors. \\n\\nElectronic  message  boards  using  a  light \\nemitting  diode  (LED)  or  ‘‘flip-dot’’  display \\nare  currently  provided  in  some  transit  sta-\\ntions and terminals and may be usable in ve-\\nhicles. These devices may be used to provide \\nreal time or pre-programmed messages; how-\\never,  real  time  message  displays  require  the \\navailability  of  an  employee  for  keyboard \\nentry of the information to be announced. \\n\\nVideo monitor systems, such as visual pag-\\ning  systems  provided  in  some  airports  (e.g., \\nBaltimore-Washington \\nInternational  Air-\\nport), are another alternative. The Architec-\\ntural  and  Transportation  Barriers  Compli-\\nance Board (Access Board) can provide tech-\\nnical  assistance  and  information  on  these \\nsystems  (‘‘Airport  TDD  Access:  Two  Case \\nStudies,’’ (1990)). \\n\\nB.  Assistive  Listening  Systems.  Assistive  lis-\\ntening  systems  (ALS)  are  intended  to  aug-\\nment  standard  public  address  and  audio  sys-\\ntems  by  providing  signals  which  can  be  re-\\nceived  directly  by  persons  with  special  re-\\nceivers  or  their  own  hearing  aids  and  which \\neliminate  or  filter  background  noise.  Mag-\\nnetic induction loops, infra-red and radio fre-\\nquency  systems  are  types  of  listening  sys-\\ntems which are appropriate for various appli-\\ncations. \\n\\nAn  assistive  listening  system  appropriate \\nfor transit vehicles, where a group of persons \\nor  where  the  specific  individuals  are  not \\nknown in advance, may be different from the \\nsystem  appropriate  for  a  particular  indi-\\nvidual provided as an auxiliary aid or as part \\nof  a  reasonable  accommodation.  The  appro-\\npriate  device  for  an  individual  is  the  type \\nthat  individual  can  use,  whereas  the  appro-\\npriate  system  for  a  station  or  vehicle  will \\nnecessarily  be  geared  toward  the  ‘‘average’’ \\nor  aggregate  needs  of  various  individuals. \\nEarphone  jacks  with  variable  volume  con-\\ntrols can benefit only people who have slight \\nhearing  loss  and  do  not  help  people  who  use \\nhearing  aids.  At  the  present  time,  magnetic \\ninduction loops are the most feasible type of \\nlistening  system  for  people  who  use  hearing \\naids  equipped  with  ‘‘T-coils’’,  but  people \\nwithout  hearing  aids  or  those  with  hearing \\naids  not  equipped  with  inductive  pick-ups \\ncannot  use  them  without  special  receivers. \\nRadio  frequency  systems  can  be  extremely \\neffective  and  inexpensive.  People  without \\nhearing  aids  can  use  them,  but  people  with \\nhearing  aids  need  a  special  receiver  to  use \\nthem as they are presently designed. If hear-\\ning  aids  had  a  jack  to  allow  a  by-pass  of \\nmicrophones,  then  radio  frequency  systems \\nwould  be  suitable  for  people  with  and  with-\\nout  hearing  aids.  Some  listening  systems \\nmay  be  subject  to  interference  from  other \\nequipment and feedback from hearing aids of \\npeople  who  are  using  the  systems.  Such  in-\\n\\nterference can be controlled by careful engi-\\nneering  design  that  anticipates  feedback \\nsources in the surrounding area. \\n\\nThe Architectural and Transportation Bar-\\nriers  Compliance  Board  (Access  Board)  has \\npublished  a  pamphlet  on  Assistive  Listening \\nSystems  which  lists  demonstration  centers \\nacross  the  country  where  technical  assist-\\nance can be obtained in selecting and install-\\ning  appropriate  systems.  The  State  of  New \\nYork  has  also  adopted  a  detailed  technical \\nspecification which may be useful. \\n\\nVI. Over-the-Road Buses \\n\\nA.  Door  Width.  Achieving  a  30  inch  wide \\nfront door on an over-the-road bus is consid-\\nered  not  feasible  if  doing  so  would  neces-\\nsitate  reduction  of  the  bus  approach  angle, \\nrelocating  the  front  axle  rearward,  or  in-\\ncreasing the bus overall length. \\n\\nB.  Restrooms.  The  following  is  provided  to \\nassist manufacturers and designers to create \\nrestrooms  which  can  be  used  by  people  with \\ndisabilities.  These  specifications  are  derived \\nfrom  requirements  for  rail  vehicles  and  rep-\\nresent  compromises  between  space  needed \\nfor  use  and  constraints  imposed  by  vehicle \\ndimensions.  As  a  result,  some  persons  with \\ndisabilities  cannot  use  a  restroom  which \\nmeets these specifications and operators who \\ndo  provide  such  restrooms  should  provide \\npassengers  with  disabilities  sufficient  ad-\\nvance information about design so that those \\npassengers  can  assess  their  ability  to  use \\nthem.  Designers  should  provide  additional \\nspace  beyond  these  minimum  specifications \\nwhenever possible. \\n\\n(1) If an accessible restroom is provided, it \\nshould  be  designed  so  as  to  allow  a  person \\nusing  a  wheelchair  or  mobility  aid  to  enter \\nand  use  such  restroom  as  specified  in  para-\\ngraphs  (1)(a)  through  (e)  of  section  VI.B  of \\nthis appendix. \\n\\n(a) The minimum clear floor area should be \\n35  inches  (890  mm)  by  60  inches  (1525  mm). \\nPermanently  installed  fixtures  may  overlap \\nthis area a maximum of 6 inches (150 mm), if \\nthe  lowest  portion  of  the  fixture  is  a  min-\\nimum  of  9  inches  (230  mm)  above  the  floor, \\nand may overlap a maximum of 19 inches (485 \\nmm), if the lowest portion of the fixture is a \\nminimum  of  29  inches  (740  mm)  above  the \\nfloor, provided such fixtures do not interfere \\nwith access to the water closet. Fold-down or \\nretractable seats or shelves may overlap the \\nclear  floor  space  at  a  lower  height  provided \\nthey can be easily folded up or moved out of \\nthe way. \\n\\n(b) The height of the water closet should be \\n17  inches  (430  mm)  to  19  inches  (485  mm) \\nmeasured to the top of the toilet seat.

Safety  requirements  must  be \\nbased  on  actual  risks  and  not  on  mere \\nspeculation, stereotypes, or generaliza-\\ntions  about  individuals  with  disabil-\\nities. \\n\\nExample  1  to  paragraph  39.27(a):  You  may \\ntake  such  action  in  order  to  comply  with \\nCoast Guard safety regulations. \\n\\nExample  2  to  paragraph  39.27(a):  You  may \\ntake  such  action  if  accommodating  a  large \\nor heavy wheelchair would, together with its \\noccupant, create weight and balance problem \\nthat could affect adversely the seaworthiness \\nof  the  vessel  or  impede  emergency  egress \\nfrom the vessel. \\n\\nExample  3  to  paragraph  39.27(a):  You  could \\nrestrict  access  to  a  lifeboat  for  a  mobility \\ndevice that would limit access to the lifeboat \\nfor other passengers. \\n\\n(b)  In  taking  action  pursuant  to  le-\\ngitimate  safety  requirements,  you \\nmust  take  the  action  that  imposes  the \\n\\nminimum  feasible  burdens  or  limita-\\ntions from the point of view of the pas-\\nsenger.  For  example,  if  you  can  meet \\nlegitimate  safety  requirements  by  a \\nmeans  short  of  refusing  transportation \\nto a passenger, you must do so. \\n\\n(c)  You  may  take  action  to  deny \\ntransportation or restrict services to a \\npassenger  if  the  passenger  poses  a  di-\\nrect  threat  to  others.  In  determining \\nwhether  an  individual  poses  a  direct \\nthreat to the health or safety of others, \\nthe  PVO  must  make  an  individualized \\nassessment,  based  on  reasonable  judg-\\nment  that  relies  on  current  medical \\nknowledge  or  on  the  best  available  ob-\\njective  evidence,  to  ascertain:  The  na-\\nture, duration, and severity of the risk; \\nthe  probability  that  the  potential  in-\\njury  will  actually  occur;  and  whether \\nreasonable  modifications  of  policies, \\npractices,  or  procedures  will  mitigate \\nthe risk. \\n\\n§ 39.29 May  PVOs  limit  the  number  of \\npassengers  with  a  disability  on  a \\npassenger vessel? \\n\\nAs  a  PVO,  you  must  not  limit  the \\nnumber  of  passengers  with  a  disability \\nother  than  individuals  with  a  mobility \\ndisability on your vessel. However, if in \\nthe  Captain’s  judgment,  weight  or  sta-\\nbility issues are presented by the pres-\\nence  of  mobility  devices  and  would \\nconflict with legitimate safety require-\\nments  pertaining  to  the  vessel  and  its \\npassengers,  then  the  number  of  pas-\\nsengers with mobility aids may be lim-\\nited, but only to the extent reasonable \\nto prevent a avoid such a conflict. \\n\\n§ 39.31 May PVOs limit access to trans-\\nportation  or  use  of  a  vessel  on  the \\nbasis  that  a  passenger  has  a  com-\\nmunicable disease? \\n\\n(a) You must not take any of the fol-\\nlowing actions on the basis that a pas-\\nsenger  has  a  communicable  disease  or \\ninfection,  unless  one  of  the  conditions \\nof  paragraph  (b)  of  this  section  exists: \\n(1)  Refuse  to  provide  transportation \\n\\nor use of a vessel to the passenger; \\n\\n(2)  Delay  the  passenger’s  transpor-\\ntation or use of the vessel (e.g., require \\nthe passenger to take a later trip); \\n\\n(3)  Impose  on  the  passenger  any  con-\\ndition,  restriction,  or  requirement  not \\nimposed on other passengers; or \\n\\n(4) Require the passenger to provide a \\n\\nmedical certificate. \\n\\n573 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00583 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0c§ 39.33 \\n\\n49 CFR Subtitle A (10–1–21 Edition) \\n\\n(b)  You  may  take  actions  listed  in \\nparagraph (a) of this section only if ei-\\nther or both of the conditions listed in \\nparagraphs (b)(1) and (2) of this section \\nare  met.

You may take an action listed in \\nparagraph (a) of this section. \\n\\nExample  4  to  paragraph  39.31(b)(2).  A  pas-\\nsenger  has  a  condition  that  is  not  readily \\ntransmissible  by  casual  contact  to  or  does \\nnot have serious health consequences for the \\ngeneral  passenger  population.  However,  it  is \\npossible that it could be readily transmitted \\nby  casual  contact  with  and  have  serious \\nhealth consequences for an individual with a \\nsevere  allergy  or  severely  compromised  im-\\nmune  system.  You  may  not  take  any  of  the \\nactions  listed  in  paragraph  (a)  of  this  sec-\\ntion. \\n\\n(c) Any action of those listed in para-\\ngraph  (a)  of  this  section  that  you  take \\nunder  paragraph  (b)  of  this  section \\nmust  be  the  least  drastic  action  you \\ncan take to protect the health of other \\npassengers.  For  example,  if  you  can \\nprotect  the  health  of  other  passenger \\nby  imposing  a  condition  on  the  trans-\\nportation  of  a  passenger  with  a  com-\\n\\nmunicable  disease  (e.g.,  limiting  the \\npassenger’s  access  to  certain  facilities \\non the vessel for a period of time), you \\ncannot  totally  deny  transportation  on \\nthe vessel. \\n\\n(d) For purposes of paragraph (a)(4) of \\nthis  section,  a  medical  certificate  is  a \\nwritten statement from the passenger’s \\nphysician  saying  that  the  passenger’s \\ndisease  or  infection  would  not,  under \\nthe present conditions in the particular \\npassenger’s  case,  be  readily  commu-\\nnicable to other persons by casual con-\\ntact  during  the  normal  course  of  the \\npassenger’s  transportation  or  use  of \\nthe  vessel.  Such  a  medical  certificate \\nmust  state  any  conditions  or  pre-\\ncautions  that  would  have  to  be  ob-\\nserved  to  prevent  the  transmission  of \\nthe  disease  or  infection  to  other  per-\\nsons  in  the  normal  course  of  the  pas-\\nsenger’s transportation on or use of the \\nvessel. It must be sufficiently recent to \\npertain  directly  to  the  communicable \\ndisease  presented  by  the  passenger  at \\nthe  time  the  passenger  seeks  to  board \\nthe vessel. \\n\\n(e)  If  your  action  under  this  section \\nresults  in  the  postponement  of  a  pas-\\nsenger’s  transportation  or  use  of  the \\nvessel,  you  must  permit  the  passenger \\nto  travel  or  use  the  vessel  at  a  later \\navailable time (up to one year from the \\ndate of the postponed trip or use of the \\nvessel) at the cost that would have ap-\\nplied  to  the  passenger’s  originally \\nscheduled trip or use of the vessel with-\\nout  penalty  or,  at  the  passenger’s  dis-\\ncretion,  provide  a  refund  for  any  un-\\nused  transportation  or  use  of  the  ves-\\nsel.

This is true whether or not you \\nchoose  to  use  a  C/TPA  as  an  inter-\\nmediary  in  transmitting  information \\nto  you.  For  example,  suppose  an  appli-\\ncant  for  a  safety-sensitive  job  takes  a \\npre-employment drug test, but there is \\na  significant  delay  in  your  receipt  of \\nthe test result from an MRO or C/TPA. \\nYou must not assume that ‘‘no news is \\ngood news’’ and permit the applicant to \\nperform  safety-sensitive  duties  before \\nreceiving the result.

Such a waiver, if granted, \\npermits  you  to  stand  an  employee \\ndown  following  the  MRO’s  receipt  of  a \\nlaboratory  report  of  a  confirmed  posi-\\ntive test for a drug or drug metabolite, \\nan  adulterated  test,  or  a  substituted \\ntest pertaining to the employee. \\n\\n(1)  For  this  purpose,  the  concerned \\nDOT agency is the one whose drug and \\nalcohol  testing  rules  apply  to  the  ma-\\njority of the covered employees in your \\norganization.

In  a  situation  where  a  C/TPA \\nhas notified an owner/operator or other \\nindividual  employee  to  report  for  test-\\ning  and  the  employee  does  not  appear, \\nthe  C/TPA  must  notify  the  employee \\nthat  he  or  she  has  refused  to  test  (see \\n§ 40.191(a)(1)). \\n\\n(b)  Ensure  that,  when  the  employee \\nenters  the  collection  site,  you  begin \\nthe  testing  process  without  undue \\ndelay. For example, you must not wait \\nbecause the employee says he or she is \\nnot ready or is unable to urinate or be-\\ncause  an  authorized  employer  or  em-\\nployee  representative  is  delayed  in  ar-\\nriving. \\n\\n(1)  If  the  employee  is  also  going  to \\ntake  a  DOT  alcohol  test,  you  must,  to \\nthe  greatest  extent  practicable,  ensure \\nthat  the  alcohol  test  is  completed  be-\\nfore  the  urine  collection  process  be-\\ngins. \\n\\nExample  to  paragraph  (b)(1):  An  employee \\nenters the test site for both a drug and an al-\\ncohol  test.  Normally,  the  collector  would \\nwait  until  the  BAT  had  completed  the  alco-\\nhol  test  process  before  beginning  the  drug \\ntest  process.  However,  there  are  some  situa-\\ntions  in  which  an  exception  to  this  normal \\npractice would be reasonable. One such situ-\\nation might be if several people were waiting \\nfor  the  BAT  to  conduct  alcohol  tests,  but  a \\ndrug  testing  collector  in  the  same  facility \\nwere free. Someone waiting might be able to \\ncomplete  a  drug  test  without  unduly  delay-\\ning  his  or  her  alcohol  test.  Collectors  and \\nBATs  should  work  together,  however,  to  en-\\nsure  that  post-accident  and  reasonable  sus-\\npicion  alcohol  tests  happen  as  soon  as  pos-\\nsible  (e.g.,  by  moving  the  employee  to  the \\nhead of the line for alcohol tests). \\n\\n(2) If the employee needs medical at-\\ntention (e.g., an injured employee in an \\nemergency  medical  facility  who  is  re-\\nquired to have a post-accident test), do \\nnot  delay  this  treatment  to  collect  a \\nspecimen. \\n\\n(3) You must not collect, by catheter-\\nization  or  other  means,  urine  from  an \\nunconscious  employee  to  conduct  a \\ndrug test under this part. Nor may you \\ncatheterize a conscious employee. How-\\never,  you  must  inform  an  employee \\nwho  normally  voids  through  self-cath-\\neterization  that  the  employee  is  re-\\nquired  to  provide  a  specimen  in  that \\nmanner. \\n\\n(4)  If,  as  an  employee,  you  normally \\nvoid  through  self-catheterization,  and \\ndecline  to  do  so,  this  constitutes  a  re-\\nfusal to test. \\n\\n(c)  Require  the  employee  to  provide \\npositive identification. You must see a \\nphoto ID issued by the employer (other \\nthan  in  the  case  of  an  owner-operator \\nor  other  self-employed  individual)  or  a \\nFederal,  state,  or  local  government \\n(e.g.,  a  driver’s  license).  You  may  not \\naccept  faxes  or  photocopies  of  identi-\\nfication.  Positive  identification  by  an \\nemployer  representative  (not  a  co- \\nworker or another employee being test-\\ned)  is  also  acceptable.  If  the  employee \\ncannot  produce  positive  identification, \\nyou  must  contact  a  DER  to  verify  the \\nidentity of the employee. \\n\\n(d) If the employee asks, provide your \\nidentification  to  the  employee.

You  must \\nalso direct the employee to leave these \\ngarments  and  any  briefcase,  purse,  or \\nother  personal  belongings  with  you  or \\nin  a  mutually  agreeable  location.  You \\nmust  advise  the  employee  that  failure \\nto  comply  with  your  directions  con-\\nstitutes a refusal to test. \\n\\n(1) If the employee asks for a receipt \\nfor  any  belongings  left  with  you,  you \\nmust provide one. \\n\\n(2)  You  must  allow  the  employee  to \\n\\nkeep his or her wallet. \\n\\n(3) You must not ask the employee to \\nremove  other  clothing  (e.g.,  shirts, \\npants,  dresses,  underwear),  to  remove \\nall  clothing,  or  to  change  into  a  hos-\\npital  or  examination  gown  (unless  the \\nurine  collection  is  being  accomplished \\nsimultaneously with a DOT agency-au-\\nthorized medical examination). \\n\\n(4)  You  must  direct  the  employee  to \\nempty  his  or  her  pockets  and  display \\nthe  items  in  them  to  ensure  that  no \\nitems  are  present  which  could  be  used \\nto  adulterate  the  specimen.

You  may  con-\\nduct  another  collection  as  part  of  this \\neffort. \\n\\n(2) If another collection is necessary, \\nyou must begin the new collection pro-\\ncedure as soon as possible, using a new \\nCCF and a new collection kit. \\n\\n(b)  If,  as  a  collector,  laboratory, \\nMRO, employer, or other person imple-\\nmenting  these  drug  testing  regula-\\ntions,  you  become  aware  of  a  problem \\nthat  can  be  corrected  (see  § 40.203),  but \\nwhich  has  not  already  been  corrected \\nunder paragraph (a) of this section, you \\nmust take all practicable action to cor-\\nrect the problem so that the test is not \\ncancelled. \\n\\n(1)  If  the  problem  resulted  from  the \\nomission  of  required  information,  you \\nmust, as the person responsible for pro-\\nviding  that  information,  supply  in \\nwriting  the  missing  information  and  a \\nstatement that it is true and accurate. \\nFor  example,  suppose  you  are  a  col-\\nlector, and you forgot to make a nota-\\ntion on the ‘‘Remarks’’ line of the CCF \\nthat the employee did not sign the cer-\\ntification.  You  would,  when  the  prob-\\nlem  is  called  to  your  attention,  supply \\na  signed  statement  that  the  employee \\nfailed  or  refused  to  sign  the  certifi-\\ncation and that your statement is true \\nand accurate. You must supply this in-\\nformation on the same business day on \\nwhich  you  are  notified  of  the  problem, \\ntransmitting it by fax or courier. \\n\\n(2) If the problem is the use of a non- \\nFederal  form  or  an  expired  Federal \\nform, you must provide a signed state-\\nment  (i.e.,  a  memorandum  for  the \\nrecord).  It  must  state  that  the  incor-\\nrect  form  contains  all  the  information \\nneeded  for  a  valid  DOT  drug  test,  and \\nthat  the  incorrect  form  was  used  inad-\\nvertently  or  as  the  only  means  of  con-\\nducting  a  test,  in  circumstances  be-\\nyond your control.

This test cannot occur  until \\nafter the SAP has determined that the \\nemployee  has  successfully  complied \\nwith prescribed education and/or treat-\\nment. The employee must have a nega-\\ntive  drug  test  result  and/or  an  alcohol \\ntest  with  an  alcohol  concentration  of \\nless than 0.02 before resuming perform-\\nance of safety-sensitive duties. \\n\\n(b) As an employer, you must not re-\\nturn  an  employee  to  safety-sensitive \\nduties  until  the  employee  meets  the \\nconditions of paragraph (a) of this  sec-\\ntion.  However,  you  are  not  required  to \\nreturn  an  employee  to  safety-sensitive \\nduties  because  the  employee  has  met \\nthese  conditions.  That  is  a  personnel \\ndecision  that  you  have  the  discretion \\nto  make,  subject  to  collective  bar-\\ngaining  agreements  or  other  legal  re-\\nquirements. \\n\\n(c)  As  a  SAP  or  MRO,  you  must  not \\nmake  a  ‘‘fitness  for  duty’’  determina-\\ntion as part of this re-evaluation unless \\nrequired  to  do  so  under  an  applicable \\nDOT  agency  regulation.  It  is  the  em-\\nployer,  rather  than  you,  who  must  de-\\ncide whether to put the employee back \\nto work in a safety-sensitive position. \\n\\n§ 40.307 What  is  the  SAP’s  function  in \\nprescribing  the  employee’s  follow- \\nup tests? \\n\\n(a) As a SAP, for each employee who \\nhas  committed  a  DOT  drug  or  alcohol \\nregulation  violation,  and  who  seeks  to \\nresume  the  performance  of  safety-sen-\\nsitive  functions,  you  must  establish  a \\nwritten  follow-up  testing  plan.  You  do \\nnot  establish  this  plan  until  after  you \\ndetermine  that  the  employee  has  suc-\\ncessfully  complied  with  your  rec-\\nommendations  for  education  and/or \\ntreatment. \\n\\n(b)  You  must  present  a  copy  of  this \\n(see \\n\\nthe  DER \\n\\nto \\n\\nplan  directly \\n§ 40.311(d)(9)). \\n\\n(c) You are the sole determiner of the \\nnumber  and  frequency  of  follow-up \\ntests  and  whether  these  tests  will  be \\nfor  drugs,  alcohol,  or  both,  unless  oth-\\nerwise directed by the appropriate DOT \\n\\nagency  regulation.  For  example,  if  the \\nemployee  had  a  positive  drug  test,  but \\nyour  evaluation  or  the  treatment  pro-\\ngram professionals determined that the \\nemployee  had  an  alcohol  problem  as \\nwell,  you  should  require  that  the  em-\\nployee  have  follow-up  tests  for  both \\ndrugs and alcohol. \\n\\n(d)  However,  you  must,  at  a  min-\\nimum, direct that the employee be sub-\\nject to six unannounced follow-up tests \\nin  the  first  12  months  of  safety-sen-\\nsitive  duty  following  the  employee’s \\nreturn to safety-sensitive functions. \\n\\n(1) You may require a greater number \\nof  follow-up  tests  during  the  first  12- \\nmonth  period  of  safety-sensitive  duty \\n(e.g., you may require one test a month \\nduring  the  12-month  period;  you  may \\nrequire two tests per month during the \\nfirst  6-month  period  and  one  test  per \\nmonth  during  the  final  6-month  pe-\\nriod). \\n\\n(2)  You  may  also  require  follow-up \\ntests  during  the  48  months  of  safety- \\nsensitive  duty  following  this  first  12- \\nmonth period. \\n\\n(3)  You  are  not  to  establish  the  ac-\\ntual  dates  for  the  follow-up  tests  you \\nprescribe.  The  decision  on  specific \\ndates to test is the employer’s. \\n\\n(4)  As  the  employer,  you  must  not \\nimpose additional testing requirements \\n(e.g.,  under  company  authority)  on  the \\nemployee that go beyond the SAP’s fol-\\nlow-up testing plan. \\n\\n(e)  The  requirements  of  the  SAP’s \\nfollow-up  testing  plan  ‘‘follow  the  em-\\nployee’’  to  subsequent  employers  or \\nthrough breaks in service. \\n\\nExample  1  to  paragraph  (e):  The  employee \\nreturns  to  duty  with  Employer  A.  Two \\nmonths afterward, after completing the first \\ntwo  of  six  follow-up  tests  required  by  the \\nSAP’s  plan,  the  employee  quits  his  job  with \\nEmployer  A  and  begins  to  work  in  a  similar \\nposition  for  Employer  B.  The  employee  re-\\nmains  obligated  to  complete  the  four  addi-\\ntional  tests  during  the  next  10  months  of \\nsafety-sensitive  duty,  and  Employer  B  is  re-\\nsponsible  for  ensuring  that  the  employee \\ndoes so. Employer B learns of this obligation \\nthrough the inquiry it makes under § 40.25. \\n\\nExample  2  to  paragraph  (e):  The  employee \\nreturns  to  duty  with  Employer  A.  Three \\nmonths  later,  after  the  employee  completes \\nthe  first  two  of  six  follow-up  tests  required \\nby the SAP’s plan, Employer A lays the em-\\nployee  off  for  economic  or  seasonal  employ-\\nment  reasons.

You  may  not  allow  the \\nemployee  to  continue  to  perform  safe-\\nty-sensitive  functions  unless  follow-up \\ntesting is conducted as directed by the \\nSAP. \\n\\n(b)  You  should  schedule  follow-up \\ntests  on  dates  of  your  own  choosing, \\nbut you must ensure that the tests are \\nunannounced  with  no  discernable  pat-\\ntern  as  to  their  timing,  and  that  the \\nemployee is given no advance notice. \\n\\n(c)  You  cannot  substitute  any  other \\ntests  (e.g.,  those  carried  out  under  the \\nrandom testing program) conducted on \\nthe employee for this follow-up testing \\nrequirement. \\n\\n(d) You cannot count a follow-up test \\nthat has been cancelled as a completed \\ntest.

For \\nexample, while you may be responsible \\nfor  transmitting  information  to  the \\nemployer  about  test  results,  you  must \\nnot act on behalf of the employer in ac-\\ntions to remove employees from safety- \\nsensitive duties. \\n\\n(l) In transmitting documents to lab-\\noratories,  you  must  ensure  that  you \\nsend  to  the  laboratory  that  conducts \\ntesting  only  Copy  1  of  the  CCF.  You \\nmust  not  transmit  other  copies  of  the \\nCCF or any ATFs to the laboratory. \\n\\n(m)  You  must  not  impose  conditions \\nor  requirements  on  employers  that \\nDOT  regulations  do  not  authorize.

We  intend  to  use  PIEs \\nonly  to  remedy  situations  of  serious \\nnoncompliance.  PIEs  are  not  used  for \\nthe purpose of punishment. \\n\\n(d)  Nothing  in  this  subpart  precludes \\na DOT agency or the Inspector General \\nfrom taking other action authorized by \\nits  regulations  with  respect  to  service \\nagents  or  employers  that  violate  its \\nregulations. \\n\\n§ 40.363 On  what  basis  may  the  De-\\n\\npartment issue a PIE? \\n\\n(a) If you are a service agent, the De-\\npartment  may  issue  a  PIE  concerning \\nyou  if  we  determine  that  you  have \\nfailed  or  refused  to  provide  drug  or  al-\\n\\ncohol  testing  services  consistent  with \\nthe requirements of this part or a DOT \\nagency drug and alcohol regulation. \\n\\n(b) The Department also may issue a \\nPIE  if  you  have  failed  to  cooperate \\nwith  DOT  agency  representatives  con-\\ncerning  inspections,  complaint  inves-\\ntigations,  compliance  and  enforcement \\nreviews, or requests for documents and \\nother  information  about  compliance \\nwith this part or DOT agency drug and \\nalcohol regulations. \\n\\n§ 40.365 What  is  the  Department’s  pol-\\nicy  concerning  starting  a  PIE  pro-\\nceeding? \\n\\n(a)  It  is  the  Department’s  policy  to \\nstart a PIE proceeding only in cases of \\nserious,  uncorrected  noncompliance \\nwith the provisions of this part, affect-\\ning  such  matters  as  safety,  the  out-\\ncomes  of  test  results,  privacy  and  con-\\nfidentiality,  due  process  and  fairness \\nfor  employees,  the  honesty  and  integ-\\nrity  of  the  testing  program,  and  co-\\noperation with or provision of informa-\\ntion to DOT agency representatives. \\n\\n(b) The following are examples of the \\nkinds of serious noncompliance that, as \\na  matter  of  policy,  the  Department \\nviews as appropriate grounds for start-\\ning  a  PIE  proceeding.  These  examples \\nare not intended to be an exhaustive or \\nexclusive  list  of  the  grounds  for  start-\\ning  a  PIE  proceeding.  We  intend  them \\nto  illustrate  the  level  of  seriousness \\nthat  the  Department  believes  supports \\nstarting  a  PIE  proceeding.

The  proposed  scope  of  the  PIE  is \\none  of  the  elements  of  the  proceeding \\nthat the service agent may contest (see \\n§ 40.381(b))  and  about  which  the  Direc-\\ntor makes a decision (see § 40.387(b)(3)). \\n(d)  In  recommending  and  deciding \\nthe  scope  of  the  PIE,  the  initiating  of-\\nficial  and  Director,  respectively,  must \\ntake  into  account  the  provisions  of \\nparagraphs  (e)  through  (j)  of  this  sec-\\ntion. \\n\\n(e)  The  pervasiveness  of  the  non-\\ncompliance within a service agent’s or-\\nganization  (see  § 40.389(d))  is  an  impor-\\ntant  consideration  in  determining  the \\nscope  of  a  PIE.  The  appropriate  scope \\nof  a  PIE  grows  broader  as  the  perva-\\nsiveness  of  the  noncompliance \\nin-\\ncreases. \\n\\n(f)  The  application  of  a  PIE  is  not \\nlimited  to  the  specific  location  or  em-\\nployer at which the conduct that forms \\nthe  factual  basis  for  issuing  the  PIE \\nwas discovered. \\n\\n(g) A PIE applies to your affiliates, if \\nthe  affiliate  is  involved  with  or  af-\\nfected  by  the  conduct  that  forms  the \\nfactual basis for issuing the PIE. \\n\\n(h)  A  PIE  applies  to  individuals  who \\nare  officers,  employees,  directors, \\nshareholders,  partners,  or  other  indi-\\nviduals  associated  with  your  organiza-\\ntion in the following circumstances: \\n\\n(1)  Conduct  forming  any  part  of  the \\nfactual  basis  of  the  PIE  occurred  in \\nconnection  with  the  individual’s  per-\\nformance  of  duties  by  or  on  behalf  of \\nyour organization; or \\n\\n(2)  The  individual  knew  of,  had  rea-\\nson to know of, approved, or acquiesced \\nin  such  conduct.  The  individual’s  ac-\\nceptance  of  benefits  derived  from  such \\nconduct is evidence of such knowledge, \\nacquiescence, or approval. \\n\\n(i)  If  a  contractor  to  your  organiza-\\ntion  is  solely  responsible  for  the  con-\\nduct  that  forms  the  factual  basis  for  a \\nPIE,  the  PIE  does  not  apply  to  the \\nservice  agent  itself  unless  the  service \\nagent  knew  or  should  have  known \\n\\nabout the conduct and did not take ac-\\ntion to correct it. \\n\\n(j)  PIEs  do  not  apply  to  drug  and  al-\\ncohol  testing  that  DOT  does  not  regu-\\nlate. \\n\\n(k) The following examples illustrate \\nhow the Department intends the provi-\\nsions of this section to work: \\n\\nExample  1  to  § 40.391.  Service  Agent  P  pro-\\nvides  a  variety  of  drug  testing  services.  P’s \\nSAP services are involved in a serious viola-\\ntion of this Part 40. However, P’s other serv-\\nices  fully  comply  with  this  part,  and  P’s \\noverall  management  did  not  plan  or  concur \\nin the noncompliance, which in fact was con-\\ntrary  to  P’s  articulated  standards.  Because \\nthe  noncompliance  was  isolated  in  one  area \\nof  the  organization’s  activities,  and  did  not \\npervade the entire organization, the scope of \\nthe PIE could be limited to SAP services. \\n\\nExample  2  to  § 40.391.  Service  Agent  Q  pro-\\nvides  a  similar  variety  of  services.  The  con-\\nduct forming the factual basis for a PIE con-\\ncerns  collections  for  a  transit  authority.  As \\nin  Example  1,  the  noncompliance  is  not  per-\\nvasive throughout Q’s organization. The PIE \\nwould  apply  to  collections  at  all  locations \\nserved  by  Q,  not  just  the  particular  transit \\nauthority  or  not  just  in  the  state  in  which \\nthe transit authority is located. \\n\\nExample  3  to  § 40.391.  Service  Agent  R  pro-\\nvides a similar array of services. One or more \\nof  the  following  problems  exists:  R’s  activi-\\nties  in  several  areas—collections,  MROs, \\nSAPs,  protecting  the  confidentiality  of  in-\\nformation—are  involved  in  serious  non-\\ncompliance;  DOT  determines  that  R’s  man-\\nagement  knew  or  should  have  known  about \\nserious noncompliance in one or more areas, \\nbut management did not take timely correc-\\ntive  action;  or,  in  response  to  an  inquiry \\nfrom  DOT  personnel,  R’s  management  re-\\nfuses  to  provide  information  about  its  oper-\\nations.  In  each  of  these  three  cases,  the \\nscope of the PIE would include all aspects of \\nR’s services. \\n\\nExample  4  to  § 40.391.  Service  Agent  W  pro-\\nvides  only  one  kind  of  service  (e.g.,  labora-\\ntory  or  MRO  services).  The  Department \\nissues  a  PIE  concerning  these  services.  Be-\\ncause W only provides this one kind of serv-\\nice, the PIE necessarily applies to all its op-\\nerations. \\n\\nExample  5  to  § 40.391.  Service  Agent  X,  by \\nexercising  reasonably  prudent  oversight  of \\nits collection contractor, should have known \\nthat  the  contractor  was  making  numerous \\n‘‘fatal  flaws’’  in  tests.  Alternatively,  X  re-\\nceived a correction notice pointing out these \\nproblems  in  its  contractor’s  collections.  In \\nneither case did X take action to correct the \\nproblem. X, as well as the contractor, would \\nbe  subject  to  a  PIE  with  respect  to  collec-\\ntions. \\n\\n675 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00685 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8010 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0c§ 40.393 \\n\\n49 CFR Subtitle A (10–1–21 Edition) \\n\\nExample 6 to § 40.391.

When \\nit  received  a  correction  notice,  Y  imme-\\ndiately  dismissed  the  erring  MRO.  In  this \\ncase, the MRO would be subject to a PIE but \\nY would not. \\n\\nExample 7 to § 40.391. The Department issues \\na PIE with respect to Service Agent Z. Z pro-\\nvides  services  for  DOT-regulated  transpor-\\ntation  employers,  a  Federal  agency  under \\nthe HHS-regulated Federal employee testing \\nprogram,  and  various  private  businesses  and \\npublic  agencies  that  DOT  does  not  regulate. \\nThe  PIE  applies  only  to  the  DOT-regulated \\ntransportation  employers  with  respect  to \\ntheir DOT-mandated testing, not to the Fed-\\neral agency or the other public agencies and \\nprivate businesses. The PIE does not prevent \\nthe  non-DOT  regulated  entities  from  con-\\ntinuing to use Z’s services. \\n\\n§ 40.393 How  long  does  a  PIE  stay  in \\n\\neffect? \\n\\n(a)  In  the  NOPE  (see  § 40.375(b)(5)), \\nthe  initiating  official  proposes  the  du-\\nration  of  the  PIE.  The  duration  of  the \\nPIE  is  one  of  the  elements  of  the  pro-\\nceeding  that  the  service  agent  may \\ncontest (see § 40.381(b)) and about which \\nthe  Director  makes  a  decision  (see \\n§ 40.387(b)(4)). \\n\\n(b)  In  deciding  upon  the  duration  of \\nthe  PIE,  the  Director  considers  the  se-\\nriousness  of  the  conduct  on  which  the \\nPIE is based and the continued need to \\nprotect  employers  and  employees  from \\nthe service agent’s noncompliance. The \\nDirector  considers  factors  such  as \\nthose  listed  in  § 40.389  in  making  this \\ndecision. \\n\\n(c)  The  duration  of  a  PIE  will  be  be-\\ntween one and five years, unless the Di-\\nrector  reduces \\nits  duration  under \\n§ 40.407. \\n\\n§ 40.395 Can  you  settle  a  PIE  pro-\\n\\nceeding? \\n\\nAt any time before the Director’s de-\\ncision,  you  and  the  initiating  official \\ncan,  with  the  Director’s  concurrence, \\nsettle a PIE proceeding. \\n\\n§ 40.397 When  does  the  Director  make \\n\\na PIE decision? \\n\\nThe  Director  makes  his  or  her  deci-\\nsion  within  60  days  of  the  date  when \\nthe  record  of  a  PIE  proceeding  is  com-\\nplete  (including  any  meeting  with  the \\nDirector  and  any  additional  fact-find-\\ning  that  is  necessary).  The  Director \\n\\nmay  extend  this  period  for  good  cause \\nfor  additional  periods  of  up  to  30  days. \\n\\n§ 40.399 How  does  the  Department  no-\\ntify service agents of its decision? \\n\\nIf you are a service agent involved in \\na PIE proceeding, the Director provides \\nyou written notice as soon as he or she \\nmakes  a  PIE  decision.  The  notice  in-\\ncludes the following elements: \\n\\n(a)  If  the  decision  is  not  to  issue  a \\nPIE, a statement of the reasons for the \\ndecision,  including  findings  of  fact \\nwith  respect  to  any  material  factual \\nissues that were in dispute. \\n\\n(b) If the decision is to issue a PIE— \\n(1) A reference to the NOPE; \\n(2) A statement of the reasons for the \\ndecision,  including  findings  of  fact \\nwith  respect  to  any  material  factual \\nissues that were in dispute; \\n\\n(3)  A  statement  of  the  scope  of  the \\n\\nPIE; and \\n\\n(4) A statement of the duration of the \\n\\nPIE. \\n\\n§ 40.401 How  does  the  Department  no-\\ntify employers and the public about \\na PIE? \\n\\n(a) The Department maintains a doc-\\nument  called  the  ‘‘List  of  Excluded \\nDrug  and  Alcohol  Service  Agents.’’ \\nThis  document  may  be  found  on  the \\nDepartment’s \\n(http:// \\nsite \\nweb \\nwww.transportation.gov/odapc) \\n.

Experience:  Minimum  requirements  are \\nfor  three  years  of  full-time  supervised  expe-\\nrience or 6,000 hours of supervised experience \\nas  an  alcoholism  and/or  drug  abuse  coun-\\nselor. The supervision must be provided by a \\nlicensed or certified practitioner. Supervised \\nexperience  is  important  if  the  individual  is \\nto be considered a professional in the field of \\nalcohol and drug abuse evaluation and coun-\\nseling. \\n\\n2. Education: There exists a requirement of \\n270  contact  hours  of  education  and  training \\nin  alcoholism  and/or  drug  abuse  or  related \\ntraining.  These  hours  can  take  the  form  of \\nformal  education,  in-service  training,  and \\nprofessional  development  courses.  Part  of \\nany  professional  counselor’s  development  is \\nparticipation  in  formal  and  non-formal  edu-\\ncation opportunities within the field. \\n\\n3. Continuing Education: The certified coun-\\nselor  must  receive  at  least  40–60  hours  of \\ncontinuing  education  units  (CEU)  during \\neach two year period. These CEUs are impor-\\ntant  to  the  counselor’s  keeping  abreast  of \\nchanges and improvements in the field. \\n\\n4.  Testing:  A  passing  score  on  a  national \\ntest  is  a  requirement.  The  test  must  accu-\\nrately measure the application of the knowl-\\nedge,  skills,  and  abilities  possessed  by  the \\ncounselor.  The  test  establishes  a  national \\nstandard that must be met to practice. \\n\\n5.  Testing  Validity:  The  certification  exam-\\nination  must  be  reviewed  by  an  independent \\nauthority  for  validity  (examination  reli-\\nability  and  relationship  to  the  knowledge, \\nskills,  and  abilities  required  by  the  coun-\\nseling  field).  The  reliability  of  the  exam  is \\nparamount  if  counselor  attributes  are  to  be \\naccurately measured. The examination pass-\\ning  score  point  must  be  placed  at  an  appro-\\npriate minimal level score as gauged by sta-\\ntistically reliable methodology. \\n\\n6.  Measurable  Knowledge  Base:  The  certifi-\\ncation  process  must  be  based  upon  measur-\\nable  knowledge  possessed  by  the  applicant \\nand verified through collateral data and test-\\ning. That level of knowledge must be of suffi-\\ncient  quantity  to  ensure  a  high  quality  of \\nSAP evaluation and referral services. \\n\\n7.  Measurable  Skills  Base:  The  certification \\nprocess  must  be  based  upon  measurable \\nskills possessed by the applicant and verified \\nthrough  collateral  data  and  testing.  That \\nlevel of skills must be of sufficient quality to \\nensure a high quality of SAP evaluation and \\nreferral services. \\n\\n8. Quality Assurance Plan: The certification \\nagency  must  ensure  that  a  means  exists  to \\ndetermine that applicant records are verified \\nas  being  true  by  the  certification  staff.  This \\nis an important check to ensure that true in-\\nformation is being accepted by the certifying \\nagency. \\n\\n680 \\n\\nVerDate Sep<11>2014  16:32 Jun 16, 2022 Jkt 253227 PO 00000 Frm 00690 Fmt 8010 Sfmt 8002 Q:\\\\49\\\\49V1.TXT PC31\\n\\nB\\nO\\nJ\\n_\\n$\\n$\\n\\nh\\nt\\ni\\n\\nI\\n\\nw\\n2\\n0\\n7\\nN\\nW\\nR\\nF\\nO\\nM\\nV\\nn\\no\\n\\ne\\nn\\ny\\na\\np\\nk\\n\\n \\n \\n \\n \\n\\x0cOffice of the Secretary of Transportation \\n\\nPt. 40, App. F \\n\\n9. Code of Ethics: Certified counselors must \\npledge  to  adhere  to  an  ethical  standard  for \\npractice.  It  must  be  understood  that  code \\nviolations  could  result  in  de-certification. \\nThese standards are vital in maintaining the \\nintegrity  of  practitioners.  High  ethical \\nstandards  are  required  to  ensure  quality  of \\nclient  care  and  confidentiality  of  client  in-\\nformation  as  well  as  to  guard  against  inap-\\npropriate referral practices. \\n\\n10.  Re-certification  Program:  Certification  is \\nnot just a one-time event. It is a continuing \\nprivilege  with  continuing  requirements. \\nAmong  these  are  continuing  education,  con-\\ntinuing  state  certification,  and  concomitant \\nadherence  to  the  code  of  ethics.  Re-certifi-\\ncation  serves  as  a  protector  of  client  inter-\\nests  by  removing  poor  performers  from  the \\ncertified practice. \\n\\n11.  Fifty  State  Coverage:  Certification  must \\nbe  available  to  qualified  counselors  in  all  50 \\nstates and, therefore, the test must be avail-\\nable  to  qualified  applicants  in  all  50  states. \\nBecause many companies are multi-state op-\\nerators, consistency in SAP evaluation qual-\\nity and opportunities is paramount. The test \\nneed  not  be  given  in  all  50 states but should \\nbe accessible to candidates from all states. \\n\\n12.  National  Commission  for  Certifying  Agen-\\ncies  (NCCA)  Accreditation:  Having  NCCA  ac-\\ncreditation  is  a  means  of  demonstrating  to \\nthe Department of Transportation that your \\ncertification has been reviewed by a panel of \\nimpartial experts that have determined that \\nyour  examination(s)  has  met  stringent  and \\nappropriate testing standards. \\n\\nAPPENDIX F  TO PART 40—DRUG AND AL-\\nCOHOL TESTING INFORMATION THAT \\nC/TPAS MAY TRANSMIT TO EMPLOY-\\nERS \\n\\n1.  If  you  are  a  C/TPA,  you  may,  acting  as \\nan  intermediary,  transmit  the  information \\nin  the  following  sections  of  this  part  to  the \\nDER for an employer, if the employer choos-\\nes  to  have  you  do  so.  These  are  the  only \\nitems that you are permitted to transmit to \\nthe employer as an intermediary.

Therefore,  the  Secretary \\nshall  make  any  future-year  or  multi- \\nyear  contingent  commitment  of  funds \\nfor  a  project  using  a  conditional  term \\nsheet.  The  conditional  term  sheet  will \\nresemble  the  standard  term  sheet  that \\nenables  the  obligation  of  budget  au-\\nthority,  but  will  also  specify  the  addi-\\ntional actions necessary to trigger sub-\\nsequent  obligation(s).  The  conditional \\nterm  sheet  will  include  fixed  dates  by \\nwhich  any  requirements  must  be  met \\nin  order  for  the  reserved  funding  to  be \\nobligated. \\n\\n(2) Upon execution of the conditional \\nterm sheet, the Secretary shall reserve \\nbudget  authority  attributable  to  the \\nappropriate  year(s).  This  reservation \\nwill ensure that a project with a condi-\\ntional commitment will have a priority \\nclaim  (along  with  that  of  any  other \\nprojects  receiving  such  contingent \\ncommitments) on budget authority be-\\ncoming  available \\nin  the  specified \\nyear(s), provided that the project spon-\\nsor satisfies each condition outlined in \\nthe  conditional  term  sheet.  The  Sec-\\nretary  will  limit  such  reservations  to \\nnot more than 50 percent of the budget \\nauthority  becoming  available  in  the \\napplicable  year(s).  If  a  multi-year  con-\\ntingent  commitment  is  made,  each \\nyear’s  loan  will  be  tied  to  distinct, \\nclearly  identified  project  segments  or \\nstages  or  other  milestones  as  specified \\nin the credit agreement. \\n\\n(e)  The  obligor  may  draw  upon  the \\nline  of  credit  only  if  net  project  reve-\\nnues  (including,  among  other  sources, \\nany  debt  service  reserve  fund)  are  in-\\nsufficient  to  pay  costs  specified  in  23 \\nU.S.C. 184(a)(2) under the line of credit, \\nincluding debt service costs.

Pursuant  to  the  Fed-\\neral  Claims  Collection  Act,  as  amend-\\ned,  and  the  FCCS,  this  part  sets  forth \\nprocedures by which the Department of \\nTransportation (DOT) and its operating \\nelements  (see  49  CFR  1.3)  through  des-\\nignated officials: \\n\\n(a) Collect claims owed to the United \\nStates arising from activities under its \\njurisdiction; \\n\\n(b)  Determine  and  collect  interest \\n\\nand other charges on those claims; \\n\\n(c) Compromise claims; and \\n(d) Refer unpaid claims for litigation. \\n\\n§ 89.3 Applicability. \\n\\n(a)  The  part  applies  to  collection  of \\nall claims due the United States under \\nthe  Federal  Claims  Collection  Act  of \\n\\n1966 as amended by the Debt Collection \\nAct  of  1982  and  the  Debt  Collection \\nAmendments  of  1986  (Pub.

Neither  does  the  proposed  rule \\napply to recovery of debts owed by cur-\\nrent or former employees of the United \\nStates governed by 5 U.S.C. 5514. \\n\\n(d)  Claims  arising  out  of  contracts \\nthat  contain  specific  provisions  relat-\\ning  to  claims  are  governed  by  those \\nspecific  provisions  to  the  extent  that \\nthose  provisions  comply  with  existing \\nlaw and with 4 CFR chapter II. \\n\\n(e)  As  used  in  this  part,  the  terms \\ndebt  and  claims  are  interchangeable \\nand have the meaning defined in 4 CFR \\n101.2(a). A debtor’s liability arising out \\nof a particular incident or adjudication \\nexclusive  of  interest,  administrative \\ncosts,  and  late  payment  penalties,  is  a \\nsingle claim. \\n\\n(f)  Except  as  provided  in  paragraphs \\n(b), (c) and (d) of this section the provi-\\nsions of this part shall apply to the col-\\nlection of all debts and claims owed to \\nany  DOT  operating  element.

This  section  forbids  cer-\\ntain actions by an officer or employee of the \\nGovernment  in  his  role  as  a  servant  or  rep-\\nresentative  of  the  Government.  Its  thrust  is \\ntherefore  to  be  distinguished  from  that  of \\nsections  203  and  205  which  forbid  certain  ac-\\ntions  in  his  capacity  as  a  representative  of \\npersons outside the Government. \\n\\nSubsection (a) in substance requires an of-\\nficer or employee of the executive branch, an \\nindependent agency or the District of Colum-\\nbia,  including  a  special  Government  em-\\nployee, to refrain from participating as such \\nin  any  matter  in  which,  to  his  knowledge, \\nhe,  his  spouse,  minor  child  or  partner  has  a \\nfinancial interest. He must also remove him-\\nself  from  a  matter  in  which  a  business  or \\nnonprofit organization with which he is con-\\nnected or is seeking employment has a finan-\\ncial interest. \\n\\nSubsection (b) permits the agency of an of-\\nficer or employee to grant him an ad hoc ex-\\nemption from subsection (a) if the outside fi-\\nnancial  interest  in  a  matter  is  deemed  not \\nsubstantial  enough  to  have  an  effect  on  the \\nintegrity  of  his  services.  Financial  interests \\nof  this  kind  may  also  be  made  nondisquali-\\nfying  by  a  general  regulation  published  in \\nthe FEDERAL REGISTER. \\n\\nSection  208  is  similar  in  purpose  to  the \\nformer  18  U.S.C.  434  but  prohibits  a  greater \\nvariety  of  conduct  than  the  ‘‘transaction  of \\nbusiness  with  * * *  [a]  business  entity’’  to \\nwhich the prohibition of section 434 was lim-\\nited. In addition, the provision in section 208 \\nincluding  the  interests  of  a  spouse  and  oth-\\ners is new, as is the provision authorizing ex-\\nemptions for insignificant interest. \\n\\n[Amdt.  99–10,  42  FR  3119,  Jan.  14,  1977,  as \\namended by 58 FR 7995, Feb. 11, 1993] \\n\\nAPPENDIX\\n\\nTO SUBTITLE A—UNITED \\nSTATES RAILWAY ASSOCIATION—EM-\\nPLOYEE RESPONSIBILITIES AND CON-\\nDUCT \\n\\nSUBPART A—GENERAL \\n\\nSec. \\n1 Purpose and policy. \\n3 Definitions. \\n5 Applicability. \\n\\nSUBPART B—ETHICAL AND OTHER CONDUCT \\nAND RESPONSIBILITIES OF EMPLOYEES \\n\\n7 General. \\n9 Gifts, entertainment, and favors. \\n11 Outside  employment  and  other  activi-\\n\\nties. \\n\\n13 Financial interests. \\n15 Conflicts of interest. \\n17 Disqualification arising from personal fi-\\n\\nnancial interests. \\n\\n19 Use  of  Association  property  or  official \\n\\ntitle. \\n\\n21 Misuse of information. \\n23\\n25 Miscellaneous provisions. \\n\\nIndebtedness. \\n\\nSUBPART C—STATEMENTS OF EMPLOYMENT \\nAND FINANCIAL INTEREST \\n\\n31 Employees required to submit statement. \\n33 Time  and  place  for  submission  of  em-\\n\\nployee statements. \\n\\n35 Supplementary statements. \\n37 Committee  on  Commerce,  Information \\n\\nnot known by employee. \\nInformation not required. \\n\\n39\\n41 Confidentiality  of  employee’s  statement. \\nInterpretation and advisory service. \\n43\\n\\nSUBPART D—DISQUALIFICATION OF FORMER \\nEMPLOYEES IN MATTERS CONNECTED WITH \\nFORMER DUTIES OR OFFICIAL RESPONSIBIL-\\nITIES; DISQUALIFICATION OF PARTNERS \\n\\n51 Matters  in  which  employee  participated \\n\\npersonally and substantially. \\n\\n53 Matters under employee’s official respon-\\n\\nsibility. \\n\\n55 Employee  with  outstanding  scientific  or \\n\\ntechnological qualifications. \\n\\n57 Partner of employee. \\nAPPENDIX 1—CATEGORIES OF FINANCIAL IN-\\nTERESTS EXEMPTED FROM THE PROHIBI-\\nTIONS OF SECTIONS 13(A), 15, AND 17(A) \\nAPPENDIX 2—LIST OF EMPLOYEES REQUIRED \\nTO SUBMIT STATEMENTS OF EMPLOYMENT \\nAND FINANCIAL INTERESTS UNDER SECTION \\n31 [RESERVED] \\n\\nAUTHORITY: Sec. 202(a)(5)(2) of the Regional \\nRail  Reorganization  Act  of  1973  (Pub.
